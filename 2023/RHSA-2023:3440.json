There are currently extensions for object relational mappers, form\nvalidation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and\nmore.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Possible disclosure of permanent session cookie due to missing Vary:\nCookie header (CVE-2023-30861)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS\nscore, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE\npage listed in the References section.\n    ",

The caching proxy does not strip or ignore response with cookies\n2. The application sets a permanent session\n3. The application does not access or modify the session during requests\n4.
