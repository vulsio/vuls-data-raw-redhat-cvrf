When parsing gitattributes, a mechanism to allow defining attributes for paths, multiple integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path patterns, attributes for a single pattern, or declared attribute names. These overflows can be triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of the commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from the index. Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether the file exists in the working tree, the index, or both.
