It includes a powerful debugger, full featured\nrequest and response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache\ncontrol headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL\nrouting system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules. Werkzeug\nis unicode aware and doesn't enforce a specific template engine, database\nadapter or anything else. It doesn't even enforce a specific way of\nhandling requests and leaves all that up to the developer. It's most useful\nfor end user applications which should work on as many server environments\nas possible (such as blogs, wikis, bulletin boards, etc.).\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* high resource usage when parsing multipart form data with many fields\n(CVE-2023-25577)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS\nscore, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE\npage listed in the References section.\n    ",

These parts can be a small amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse, and may use more memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that accesses request.data, request.form, request.files, or request.get_data(parse_form_data=False), it can cause unexpectedly high resource usage, allowing an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes from handling legitimate requests, and if many concurrent requests are sent continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers.",
