				"text": "\nDebezium is a distributed platform that turns your existing databases into event streams, so applications can see and respond immediately to each row-level change in the databases.\n\nDebezium is built on top of Apache Kafka and provides Kafka Connect compatible connectors that monitor specific database management systems. Debezium records the history of data changes in Kafka logs, from where your application consumes them. This makes it possible for your application to easily consume all of the events correctly and completely. Even if your application stops unexpectedly, it will not miss anything: when the application restarts, it will resume consuming the events where it left off.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* jdbc-postgresql: postgresql-jdbc: PreparedStatement.setText(int, InputStream) will create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k (CVE-2022-41946) \n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n    ",
