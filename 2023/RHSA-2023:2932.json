					"text": "A double-free vulnerability was found in OpenSSL's PEM_read_bio_ex function. The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the \"name\" (for example, \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data, and the payload data. If the function succeeds, then the \"name_out,\" \"header,\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. Constructing a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data is possible. In this case, PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a freed buffer. A double-free will occur if the caller also frees this buffer. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who can supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.",

					"text": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in OpenSSL's BIO_new_NDEF function. The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally by OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS, and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but it may also be called directly by end-user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions. For example, if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed, and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up, and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then calls BIO_pop() on the BIO, a use-after-free will occur, possibly resulting in a crash.",

					"text": "A type confusion vulnerability was found in OpenSSL when OpenSSL X.400 addresses processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. When CRL checking is enabled (for example, the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or cause a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, of which neither needs a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. In this case, this vulnerability is likely only to affect applications that have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.",
