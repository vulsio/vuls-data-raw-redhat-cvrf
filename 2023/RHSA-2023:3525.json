The caching proxy does not strip or ignore response with cookies\n2. The application sets a permanent session\n3. The application does not access or modify the session during requests\n4. SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST is enabled, which is the default Flask behavior\n5. The application does not set the Cache-Control header to avoid being cached",
