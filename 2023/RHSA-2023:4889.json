The PKCS#11 feature in the ssh-agent in OpenSSH has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system (the code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent). This flaw allows an attacker with control of the forwarded agent-socket on the server and the ability to write to the filesystem of the client host to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the ssh-agent.",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
