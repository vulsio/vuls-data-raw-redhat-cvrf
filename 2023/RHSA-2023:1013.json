Storage clusters can scale\nhorizontally by adding new nodes, which are automatically configured.\nShould a node fail, OpenStack works to replicate its content from other\nactive nodes. Because OpenStack uses software logic to ensure data\nreplication and distribution across different devices, inexpensive\ncommodity hard drives and servers can be used in lieu of more expensive\nequipment.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* Arbitrary file access through custom S3 XML entities (CVE-2022-47950)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS\nscore, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE\npage listed in the References section.\n    ",
