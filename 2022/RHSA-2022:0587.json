This resulted in some Ceilometer metrics not being stored in Prometheus. In this release, the processing of metrics has been enhanced to be more robust. While the sg-core has been enhanced to support larger messages from Ceilometer, an additional change is required to support passing the larger messages through the sg-bridge ring buffer. The changes required to fully support this functionality are being tracked in RHBZ#2053683. (BZ#2016460)\n    ",
