As part of an HTTP alarm action, a user could pass in a trust ID. However, the trust could be from anyone because it was not verified. Because the trust was then used by openstack-aodh to obtain a keystone token for the alarm action, a malicious user could pass in another person's trust ID and obtain a keystone token containing the delegated authority of that user. (CVE-2017-12440)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Luke Hinds (Red Hat). Upstream acknowledges Zane Bitter (Red Hat) as the original reporter.\n    ",
