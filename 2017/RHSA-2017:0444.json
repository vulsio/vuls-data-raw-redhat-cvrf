It provides commands which can be used both on client systems as well as server-side composes. The rpm-ostree-client package provides commands usable on client systems to upgrade and rollback.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: rpm-ostree (2017.1), rpm-ostree-client (2017.1). (BZ#1416089)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that rpm-ostree and rpm-ostree-client fail to properly check GPG signatures on packages when doing layering. Packages with unsigned or badly signed content could fail to be rejected as expected. This issue is partially mitigated on RHEL Atomic Host, where certificate pinning is used by default. (CVE-2017-2623)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Colin Walters (Red Hat).\n    ",
