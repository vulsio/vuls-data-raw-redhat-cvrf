However, this was incorrect, as that issue only affected RPM installations and not zip files as provided by this erratum.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that the code that parsed the HTTP request line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack and/or obtain sensitive information from requests other then their own. (CVE-2016-6816)\n\n* An EAP feature to download server log files allows logs to be available via GET requests making them vulnerable to cross-origin attacks. An attacker could trigger the user's browser to request the log files consuming enough resources that normal server functioning could be impaired. (CVE-2016-8627)\n\n* It was discovered that when configuring RBAC and marking information as sensitive, users with a Monitor role are able to view the sensitive information. (CVE-2016-7061)\n\nThe CVE-2016-8627 issue was discovered by Darran Lofthouse and Brian Stansberry (Red Hat).\n    ",
