Specifically, the following were reset to 0: net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-arptables, net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables, and net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables. The race was only triggered by an update, at which point an attacker could access exposed tenant VMs and network resources. (CVE-2017-7543)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Paul Needle (Red Hat).\n    ",
