(CVE-2017-5637)\n\n* It was discovered that the XmlUtils class in jbpmmigration performed expansion of external parameter entities while parsing XML files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server and, potentially, perform other more advanced XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks. (CVE-2017-7545)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Man Yue Mo (Semmle) for reporting CVE-2017-7545.\n    ",
