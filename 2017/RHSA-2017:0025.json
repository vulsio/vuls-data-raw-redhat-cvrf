Some API services in Red Hat OpenStack Platform director are not exposed to public networks, which meant their $public_ssl_port value was set to empty (for example, openstack-glance, which is deployed by default on both undercloud and overcloud). If SSL was enabled, a malicious user could use these open ports to gain access to unauthorized resources. (CVE-2016-9599)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Ben Nemec (Red Hat).\n    ",
