				"text": "\nRed Hat Mobile Application Platform (RHMAP) 4.5 consists of three main components:\n\n* Core - development and management of apps occurs in the RHMAP Core, which can be installed either in an on-premise installation of OpenShift Container Platform 3.x.\n\n* MBaaS - Application data, runtimes, and integrations are deployed to the RHMAP MBaaS installed on OpenShift Container Platform 3.x.\n\n* Build Farm - deployed separately from the Core and the MBaaS, the Build Farm is shared between all instances of RHMAP. Third-party Linux, Windows, and Apple server hosting providers are used to support building client app binaries for all platforms.\n\nThe Core and MBaaS in RHMAP 4.5 are built on top of OpenShift Container Platform 3.x, Kubernetes, Docker, and Red Hat Software Collections. The Core and MBaaS both consist of several components, each running in its own container. Similarly, every cloud app deployed to the MBaaS runs in a container. Those containers are deployed and orchestrated by Kubernetes.\n\nThis release includes the option of provisioning a self-managed Build Farm on your infrastructure, to build Client Apps without relying on hosted Build Farm. For prerequisites and installation instructions, see the Installing RHMAP guide.\n\nFor this RHMAP release, the Docker-formatted container images required to run the Core and MBaaS inside OpenShift Container Platform 3.x are:\n\nrhmap45/fh-aaa:1.0.5-12\nrhmap45/fh-appstore:2.0.3-12\nrhmap45/fh-mbaas:5.8.1-1 \nrhmap45/fh-messaging:3.0.9-2\nrhmap45/fh-metrics:3.0.7-2\nrhmap45/fh-ngui:5.11.5-2\nrhmap45/fh-scm:1.0.8-3\nrhmap45/fh-statsd:2.0.4-14\nrhmap45/fh-supercore:4.22.0-3\nrhmap45/fh-sdks:1.0.0-30\nrhmap45/gitlab-shell:2.1.2-8\nrhmap45/httpd:2.4-38\nrhmap45/memcached:1.4.15-26\nrhmap45/millicore:7.49.1-1\nrhmap45/mongodb:3.2-29\nrhmap45/mysql:5.5-22\nrhmap45/nagios:4.0.8-50\nrhmap45/redis:2.8.21-34 \nrhmap45/ups-eap:1.1.4-27 \nrhmap45/wildcard-proxy:1.0.0-12\nrhmap45/gitlab-migrate:1.0.0-9\nrhmap45/installer:1.0.0-23\n\nThis release serves as an update for Red Hat Mobile Application Platform 4.4.3. It includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the Red Hat Mobile Application Platform 4.5.0 Release Notes for information about the most significant bug fixes and enhancements included in this release.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A shell command injection flaw related to the handling of \"ssh\" URLs has been discovered in Git. An attacker could use this flaw to execute shell commands with the privileges of the user running the Git client, for example, when performing a \"clone\" action on a malicious repository or a legitimate repository containing a malicious commit. (CVE-2017-1000117)\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the file editor of millicore which allows files to be executed as well as created. An attacker could use this flaw to compromise other users or teams projects stored in source control management of the RHMAP Core installation. (CVE-2017-7552)\n\n* The external_request api call in App Studio (millicore) allows server side request forgery (SSRF). An attacker could use this flaw to probe the network internal resources and access restricted endpoints. (CVE-2017-7553)\n\n* A flaw was found where the App Studio component of RHMAP 4.4 executes javascript provided by a user. An attacker could use this flaw to execute a stored XSS attack on an application administrator using App Studio. (CVE-2017-7554)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Tomas Rzepka for reporting CVE-2017-7552, CVE-2017-7553 and CVE-2017-7554.\n    ",
