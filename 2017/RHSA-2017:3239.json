A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n[Updated 21st November 2017]\nPreviously, this erratum was marked as a replacement of the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.16 Natives. This was incorrect; the erratum is an update, not a replacement. The erratum text has been modified to reflect this.\n    ",

				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications based on the JBoss Application Server.\n\nThis release provides an update to httpd and OpenSSL. The updates are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nThe httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful, efficient, and extensible web server.\n\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength general-purpose cryptography library.\n\nThis release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.18 Natives serves as an update to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4.16 Natives and includes bug fixes which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 Natives are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* It was discovered that the httpd's mod_auth_digest module did not properly initialize memory before using it when processing certain headers related to digest authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose potentially sensitive information or cause httpd child process to crash by sending specially crafted requests to a server. (CVE-2017-9788)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the DES/3DES cipher was used as part of the TLS/SSL protocol. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to recover some plaintext data by capturing large amounts of encrypted traffic between TLS/SSL server and client if the communication used a DES/3DES based ciphersuite. (CVE-2016-2183)\n\n* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way httpd handled invalid and previously unregistered HTTP methods specified in the Limit directive used in an .htaccess file. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to disclose portions of the server memory, or cause httpd child process to crash. (CVE-2017-9798)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank OpenVPN for reporting CVE-2016-2183 and Hanno Böck for reporting CVE-2017-9798. Upstream acknowledges Karthikeyan Bhargavan (Inria) and Gaëtan Leurent (Inria) as the original reporters of CVE-2016-2183.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* CRL checking of very large CRLs fails with OpenSSL 1.0.2 (BZ#1508880)\n\n* mod_cluster segfaults in process_info() due to wrongly generated assembler instruction movslq (BZ#1508884)\n\n* Corruption in nodestatsmem in multiple core dumps but in different functions of each core dump. (BZ#1508885)\n    ",
