				"text": "\nThe ovirt-node-ng packages provide the Red Hat Virtualization Host. These packages include redhat-release-virtualization-host, ovirt-node, and rhev-hypervisor. Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks.\n\nChanges to the ovirt-node-ng component:\n\n* Later versions of RHV 4.1 dropped ntpd as a dependency from VDSM in favor of chrony. Earlier versions, however, had included ntpd and users had come to rely on it for time configuration. When the dependency was dropped, RHVH no longer included ntpd. Now, RHVH images once more include ntpd. As a result, ntpd configurations from earlier versions of RHV will continue to work. (BZ#1476650)\n\nChanges to the rhev-hypervisor-ng component:\n\n* In order to enable services added in new layers, RHVH synchronizes systemd levels. Previously, if a default service was disabled by users, it was re-enabled when RHVH was upgraded. Now, systemd service status has improved synchronization logic when upgrades are performed, so disabled services stay disabled. (BZ#1473307)\n    ",
