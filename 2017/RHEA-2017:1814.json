				"text": "\nThe Red Hat Virtualization Manager is a centralized management platform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual machines. The Manager provides a comprehensive range of features including search capabilities, resource management, live migrations, and virtual infrastructure provisioning.\n\nThe Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several interfaces for accessing and interacting with the virtual environment, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API).\n\nChanges to the ovirt-engine component:\n\n* Previously, users could  use the REST API to add/edit affinity labels for virtual machines and hosts, but they could not view this information in the Administration Portal.\n\nIn this release, affinity label information is now available in the Administration Portal. It can be seen in the Add/Edit windows for virtual machines and hosts. The window displays all available affinity labels in the system, and for entities with assigned labels, those labels are selected. (BZ#1465862)\n\n* Previously, when creating a new VLAN-tagged network, the Manager did not allow the same VLAN ID to be duplicated across various entities, such as networks and data centers.\n\nIn this release, it is now possible to use the same VLAN ID across multiple entities, as long as they are not used on the same interface on the hardware node. (BZ#1467058)\n\n* Previously, if a host is in maintenance mode and a user calls GET /ovirt-engine/api/hosts/64fc087f-821b-429a-b274-5e8597a88f3d/storage through the REST API, the Manager would try to call getDeviceList on the host, and as a result it would be fenced.\nIn this release, a validation has been added which first checks to see if the host is in maintenance mode. The Manager will only call getDeviceList if the host is up. (BZ#1468999)\n    ",
