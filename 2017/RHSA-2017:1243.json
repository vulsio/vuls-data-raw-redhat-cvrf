Additionally, Orchestration can be integrated with Telemetry alarms to implement auto-scaling for certain infrastructure resources.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: openstack-heat (7.0.2). (BZ#1431258)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* An access-control flaw was found in the OpenStack Orchestration (heat) service where a service log directory was improperly made world readable. A malicious system user could exploit this flaw to access sensitive information. (CVE-2017-2621)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Hans Feldt (Ericsson) for reporting this issue.\n    ",
