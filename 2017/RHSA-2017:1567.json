				"text": "\nRed Hat Container Development Kit is a platform for developing containerized applications — it is a set of tools that enables developers to quickly and easily set up an environment for developing and testing containerized applications on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform.\n\nWith this update, Container Development Kit has been updated to 3.0.0-2, which includes an updated Red Hat Enterprise Linux ISO that contains fixes for the following security issues.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A null pointer dereference flaw was found in the way NSS handled empty SSLv2 messages. An attacker could use this flaw to crash a server application compiled against the NSS library. (CVE-2017-7502)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way memory was being allocated on the stack for user space binaries. If heap (or different memory region) and stack memory regions were adjacent to each other, an attacker could use this flaw to jump over the stack guard gap, cause controlled memory corruption on process stack or the adjacent memory region, and thus increase their privileges on the system. This is a kernel-side mitigation which increases the stack guard gap size from one page to 1 MiB to make successful exploitation of this issue more difficult. (CVE-2017-1000364)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way memory was being allocated on the stack for user space binaries. If heap (or different memory region) and stack memory regions were adjacent to each other, an attacker could use this flaw to jump over the stack guard gap, cause controlled memory corruption on process stack or the adjacent memory region, and thus increase their privileges on the system. This is glibc-side mitigation which blocks processing of LD_LIBRARY_PATH for programs running in secure-execution mode and reduces the number of allocations performed by the processing of LD_AUDIT, LD_PRELOAD, and LD_HWCAP_MASK, making successful exploitation of this issue more difficult. (CVE-2017-1000366)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Qualys Research Labs for reporting CVE-2017-1000364 and CVE-2017-1000366.\n    ",
