The flaw is due to lack of sanitation of user input when creating new lists. Remote, authenticated attackers that have privileges to create lists can store scripts in them, which are not properly sanitized before showing to other users, including admins. (CVE-2017-2674)\n\n* JBoss BRMS 6 and BPM Suite 6 are vulnerable to a reflected XSS via artifact upload. A malformed XML file, if uploaded, causes an error message to appear that includes part of the bad XML code verbatim without filtering out scripts. Successful exploitation would allow execution of script code within the context of the affected user. (CVE-2017-7463)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Chris Hebert, Vikas Pandey, Harold Schliesske, and Ryan Stanley (Noblis) for reporting these issues.\n    ",
