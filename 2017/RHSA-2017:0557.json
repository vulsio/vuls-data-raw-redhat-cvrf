				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss BPM Suite is a business rules and processes management system for the management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss rules and BPMN2-compliant business processes.\n\nThis release of Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.2 serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite 6.4.1, and includes bug fixes and enhancements, which are documented in the Release Notes document linked to in the References.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* JBoss BPM Suite 6 is vulnerable to a reflected XSS via dashbuilder. Remote attackers can entice authenticated users that have privileges to access dashbuilder (usually admins) to click on links to /dashbuilder/Controller containing malicious scripts. Successful exploitation would allow execution of script code within the context of the affected user. (CVE-2016-6343)\n\n* It has been reported that CSRF tokens are not properly handled in JBoss BPM suite dashbuilder. Old tokens generated during an active session can be used to bypass CSRF protection. In addition, the tokens are sent in query string so they can be exposed through the browser's history, referrers, web logs, and other sources. Attackers may be able to obtain old tokens from various sources in the network and perform CSRF attacks successfully. (CVE-2016-7034)\n\n* It was discovered that the Dashbuilder login page could be opened in an IFRAME, which made it possible to intercept and manipulate requests. An attacker could use this flaw to trick a user into performing arbitrary actions in the Console (clickjacking). (CVE-2017-2658)\n\nThe CVE-2016-6343 and CVE-2016-7034 issues were discovered by Jeremy Choi (Red Hat Product Security Team) and the CVE-2017-2658 issue was discovered by Martin Weiler (Red Hat).\n    ",
