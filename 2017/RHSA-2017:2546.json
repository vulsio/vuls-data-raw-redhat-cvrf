(CVE-2017-7525)\n\n* A vulnerability was found in Jasypt that would allow an attacker to perform a timing attack on password hash comparison. (CVE-2014-9970)\n\n* An XXE vulnerability was found in Apache Batik which could allow a remote attacker to retrieve the files on the vulnerable server's filesystem by uploading specially crafted SVG images. The vulnerability could also allow a denial of service condition by performing an amplification attack. (CVE-2017-5662)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Liao Xinxi (NSFOCUS) for reporting CVE-2017-7525.\n    ",
