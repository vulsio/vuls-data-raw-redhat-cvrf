A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2016-2175)\n\n* It was found that the parsing of OOXML, XMP in PDF, and some other file formats by Apache Tika would expand entity references. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2016-4434)\n\n* It was discovered that JBoss BRMS 6 and BPM Suite 6 are not setting HttpOnly flags on sensitive cookies. Remote attackers can access these cookies by using client-side scripts, usually through XSS. Please note that on IBM WebSphere the HttpOnly flag cannot be set by deployed applications, it needs to be configured directly on WAS console. (CVE-2016-6344)\n\nThe CVE-2016-6344 issue was discovered by Jeremy Choi (Red Hat Product Security Team).\n    ",
