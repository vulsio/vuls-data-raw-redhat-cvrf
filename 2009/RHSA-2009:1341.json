				"text": "\nThe Cluster Manager (cman) utility provides services for managing a Linux\ncluster.\n\nMultiple insecure temporary file use flaws were found in fence_apc_snmp and\nccs_tool. A local attacker could use these flaws to overwrite an arbitrary\nfile writable by a victim running those utilities (typically root) with\nthe output of the utilities via a symbolic link attack. (CVE-2008-4579,\nCVE-2008-6552)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* a buffer could overflow if cluster.conf had more than 52 entries per\nblock inside the <cman> block. The limit is now 1024.\n\n* the output of the group_tool dump subcommands were NULL padded.\n\n* using device=\"\" instead of label=\"\" no longer causes qdiskd to\nincorrectly exit.\n\n* the IPMI fencing agent has been modified to time out after 10 seconds. It\nis also now possible to specify a different timeout value with the '-t'\noption.\n\n* the IPMI fencing agent now allows punctuation in passwords.\n\n* quickly starting and stopping the cman service no longer causes the\ncluster membership to become inconsistent across the cluster.\n\n* an issue with lock syncing caused 'receive_own from' errors to be logged\nto '/var/log/messages'.\n\n* an issue which caused gfs_controld to segfault when mounting hundreds of\nfile systems has been fixed.\n\n* the LPAR fencing agent now properly reports status when an LPAR is in\nOpen Firmware mode.\n\n* the LPAR fencing agent now works properly with systems using the\nIntegrated Virtualization Manager (IVM).\n\n* the APC SNMP fencing agent now properly recognizes outletStatusOn and\noutletStatusOff return codes from the SNMP agent.\n\n* the WTI fencing agent can now connect to fencing devices with no\npassword.\n\n* the rps-10 fencing agent now properly performs a reboot when run with no\noptions.\n\n* the IPMI fencing agent now supports different cipher types with the '-C'\noption.\n\n* qdisk now properly scans devices and partitions.\n\n* cman now checks to see if a new node has state to prevent killing the\nfirst node during cluster setup.\n\n* 'service qdiskd start' now works properly.\n\n* the McData fence agent now works properly with the McData Sphereon 4500\nFabric Switch.\n\n* the Egenera fence agent can now specify an SSH login name.\n\n* the APC fence agent now works with non-admin accounts when using the\n3.5.x firmware.\n\n* fence_xvmd now tries two methods to reboot a virtual machine.\n\n* connections to OpenAIS are now allowed from unprivileged CPG clients with\nthe user and group of 'ais'.\n\n* groupd no longer allows the default fence domain to be '0', which\npreviously caused rgmanager to hang. Now, rgmanager no longer hangs.\n\n* the RSA fence agent now supports SSH enabled RSA II devices.\n\n* the DRAC fence agent now works with the Integrated Dell Remote Access\nController (iDRAC) on Dell PowerEdge M600 blade servers.\n\n* fixed a memory leak in cman.\n\n* qdisk now displays a warning if more than one label is found with the\nsame name.\n\n* the DRAC5 fencing agent now shows proper usage instructions for the '-D'\noption.\n\n* cman no longer uses the wrong node name when getnameinfo() fails.\n\n* the SCSI fence agent now verifies that sg_persist is installed.\n\n* the DRAC5 fencing agent now properly handles modulename.\n\n* QDisk now logs warning messages if it appears its I/O to shared storage\nis hung.\n\n* fence_apc no longer fails with a pexpect exception.\n\n* removing a node from the cluster using 'cman_tool leave remove' now\nproperly reduces the expected_votes and quorum.\n\n* a semaphore leak in cman has been fixed.\n\n* 'cman_tool nodes -F name' no longer segfaults when a node is out of\nmembership.\n\nEnhancements:\n\n* support for: ePowerSwitch 8+ and LPAR/HMC v3 devices, Cisco MDS 9124 and\nMDS 9134 SAN switches, the virsh fencing agent, and broadcast communication\nwith cman.\n\n* fence_scsi limitations added to fence_scsi man page.\n\nUsers of cman are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues and add these enhancements.\n    ",
