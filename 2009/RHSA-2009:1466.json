				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update includes backported fixes for two security issues. These issues\nonly affected users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 Extended Update Support\nas they have already been addressed for users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\nin the 5.4 update, RHSA-2009:1243.\n\nIn accordance with the support policy, future security updates to Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5.3 Extended Update Support will only include issues of\ncritical security impact.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* it was discovered that, when executing a new process, the clear_child_tid\npointer in the Linux kernel is not cleared. If this pointer points to a\nwritable portion of the memory of the new program, the kernel could corrupt\nfour bytes of memory, possibly leading to a local denial of service or\nprivilege escalation. (CVE-2009-2848, Important)\n\n* a flaw was found in the way the do_sigaltstack() function in the Linux\nkernel copies the stack_t structure to user-space. On 64-bit machines, this\nflaw could lead to a four-byte information leak. (CVE-2009-2847, Moderate)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* a regression was found in the SCSI retry logic: SCSI mode select was not\nretried when retryable errors were encountered. In Device-Mapper Multipath\nenvironments, this could cause paths to fail, or possibly prevent\nsuccessful failover. (BZ#506905)\n\n* the gcc flag \"-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks\" was added to the kernel\nbuild options. This prevents gcc from optimizing out NULL pointer checks\nafter the first use of a pointer. NULL pointer bugs are often exploited by\nattackers, and keeping these checks is considered a safety measure.\n(BZ#515468)\n\n* due to incorrect APIC timer calibration, a system hang could have\noccurred while booting certain systems. This incorrect timer calibration\ncould have also caused the system time to become faster or slower. With\nthis update, it is still possible for APIC timer calibration issues to\noccur; however, a clear warning is now provided if they do. (BZ#521237)\n\n* gettimeofday() experienced poor performance (which caused performance\nproblems for applications using gettimeofday()) when running on hypervisors\nthat use hardware assisted virtualization. With this update, MFENCE/LFENCE\nis used instead of CPUID for gettimeofday() serialization, which resolves\nthis issue. (BZ#523280)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
