				"text": "\nThe nfs-utils package provides a daemon for the kernel NFS server and\nrelated tools.\n\nIt was discovered that nfs-utils did not use tcp_wrappers correctly.\nCertain hosts access rules defined in \"/etc/hosts.allow\" and\n\"/etc/hosts.deny\" may not have been honored, possibly allowing remote\nattackers to bypass intended access restrictions. (CVE-2008-4552)\n\nThis updated package also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* the \"LOCKD_TCPPORT\" and \"LOCKD_UDPPORT\" options in \"/etc/sysconfig/nfs\"\nwere not honored: the lockd daemon continued to use random ports. With this\nupdate, these options are honored. (BZ#434795)\n\n* it was not possible to mount NFS file systems from a system that has\nthe \"/etc/\" directory mounted on a read-only file system (this could occur\non systems with an NFS-mounted root file system). With this update, it is\npossible to mount NFS file systems from a system that has \"/etc/\" mounted\non a read-only file system. (BZ#450646)\n\n* arguments specified by \"STATDARG=\" in \"/etc/sysconfig/nfs\" were removed\nby the nfslock init script, meaning the arguments specified were never\npassed to rpc.statd. With this update, the nfslock init script no longer\nremoves these arguments. (BZ#459591)\n\n* when mounting an NFS file system from a host not specified in the NFS\nserver's \"/etc/exports\" file, a misleading \"unknown host\" error was logged\non the server (the hostname lookup did not fail). With this update, a\nclearer error message is provided for these situations. (BZ#463578)\n\n* the nhfsstone benchmark utility did not work with NFS version 3 and 4.\nThis update adds support to nhfsstone for NFS version 3 and 4. The new\nnhfsstone \"-2\", \"-3\", and \"-4\" options are used to select an NFS version\n(similar to nfsstat(8)). (BZ#465933)\n\n* the exportfs(8) manual page contained a spelling mistake, \"djando\", in\nthe EXAMPLES section. (BZ#474848)\n\n* in some situations the NFS server incorrectly refused mounts to hosts\nthat had a host alias in a NIS netgroup. (BZ#478952)\n\n* in some situations the NFS client used its cache, rather than using\nthe latest version of a file or directory from a given export. This update\nadds a new mount option, \"lookupcache=\", which allows the NFS client to\ncontrol how it caches files and directories. Note: The Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 5.4 kernel update (the fourth regular update) must be installed in\norder to use the \"lookupcache=\" option. Also, \"lookupcache=\" is currently\nonly available for NFS version 3. Support for NFS version 4 may be\nintroduced in future Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 updates. Refer to Red Hat\nBugzilla #511312 for further information. (BZ#489335)\n\nUsers of nfs-utils should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues. After installing this update,\nthe nfs service will be restarted automatically.\n    ",
