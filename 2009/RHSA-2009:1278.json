				"text": "\nLFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program for the FTP and HTTP\nprotocols. Like bash, it has job control and uses the readline library for\ninput. It has bookmarks, built-in mirroring, and can transfer several files\nin parallel. It is designed with reliability in mind.\n\nIt was discovered that lftp did not properly escape shell metacharacters\nwhen generating shell scripts using the \"mirror --script\" command. A\nmirroring script generated to download files from a malicious FTP server\ncould allow an attacker controlling the FTP server to run an arbitrary\ncommand as the user running lftp. (CVE-2007-2348)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* when using the \"mirror\" or \"get\" commands with the \"-c\" option, lftp did\nnot check for some specific conditions that could result in the program\nbecoming unresponsive, hanging and the command not completing. For example,\nwhen waiting for a directory listing, if lftp received a \"226\" message,\ndenoting an empty directory, it previously ignored the message and kept\nwaiting. With this update, these conditions are properly checked for and\nlftp no longer hangs when \"-c\" is used with \"mirror\" or \"get\". (BZ#422881)\n\n* when using the \"put\", \"mput\" or \"reput\" commands over a Secure FTP (SFTP)\nconnection, specifying the \"-c\" option sometimes resulted in corrupted\nfiles of incorrect size. With this update, using these commands over SFTP\nwith the \"-c\" option works as expected, and transferred files are no\nlonger corrupted in the transfer process. (BZ#434294)\n\n* previously, LFTP linked to the OpenSSL library. OpenSSL's license is,\nhowever, incompatible with LFTP's GNU GPL license and LFTP does not include\nan exception allowing OpenSSL linking. With this update, LFTP links to the\nGnuTLS (GNU Transport Layer Security) library, which is released under the\nGNU LGPL license. Like OpenSSL, GnuTLS implements the SSL and TLS\nprotocols, so functionality has not changed. (BZ#458777)\n\n* running \"help mirror\" from within lftp only presented a sub-set of the\navailable options compared to the full list presented in the man page. With\nthis update, running \"help mirror\" in lftp presents the same list of mirror\noptions as is available in the Commands section of the lftp man page.\n(BZ#461922)\n\n* LFTP imports gnu-lib from upstream. Subsequent to gnu-lib switching from\nGNU GPLv2 to GNU GPLv3, the LFTP license was internally inconsistent, with\nLFTP licensed as GNU GPLv2 but portions of the package apparently licensed\nas GNU GPLv3 because of changes made by the gnu-lib import. With this\nupdate, LFTP itself switches to GNU GPLv3, resolving the inconsistency.\n(BZ#468858)\n\n* when the \"ls\" command was used within lftp to present a directory listing\non a remote system connected to via HTTP, file names containing spaces were\npresented incorrectly. This update corrects this behavior. (BZ#504591)\n\n* the default alias \"edit\" did not define a default editor. If EDITOR was\nnot set in advance by the system, lftp attempted to execute\n\"~/.lftp/edit.tmp.$$\" (which failed because the file is not set to\nexecutable). The edit alias also did not support tab-completion of file\nnames and incorrectly interpreted file names containing spaces. The updated\npackage defines a default editor (vi) in the absence of a system-defined\nEDITOR. The edit alias now also supports tab-completion and handles file\nnames containing spaces correctly for both downloading and uploading.\n(BZ#504594)\n\nNote: This update upgrades LFTP from version 3.7.3 to upstream version\n3.7.11, which incorporates a number of further bug fixes to those noted\nabove. For details regarding these fixes, refer to the\n\"/usr/share/doc/lftp-3.7.11/NEWS\" file after installing this update.\n(BZ#308721)\n\nAll LFTP users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues.\n    ",
