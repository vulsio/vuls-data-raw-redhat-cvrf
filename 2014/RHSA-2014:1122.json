				"text": "\nThe OpenStack Identity service (Keystone) authenticates and authorizes\nOpenStack users by keeping track of users and their permitted activities.\nThe Identity service supports multiple forms of authentication, including\nuser name and password credentials, token-based systems, and AWS-style\nlogins.\n\nIt was found that the MySQL token driver did not correctly store token\nexpiration times, which prevented manual token revocation. Only OpenStack\nIdentity setups configured to make use of revocation events were affected.\n(CVE-2014-5251)\n\nA flaw was found in keystone revocation events that resulted in the\n\"issued_at\" time being updated when a token created by the V2 API was\nprocessed by the V3 API. This could allow a user to evade token revocation.\nOnly OpenStack Identity setups configured to make use of revocation events\nand UUID tokens were affected. (CVE-2014-5252)\n\nIt was discovered that domain-scoped tokens were not revoked when a domain\nwas disabled. Only OpenStack Identity setups configured to make use of\nrevocation events were affected. (CVE-2014-5253)\n\nThe openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2014.1.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.\nThe most notable bug fixes are:\n\n* When a scoped token that was created from an unscoped token was revoked,\nthe original token was revoked as well. This was because the scope was not\nincluded in the revocation event. By including the scope in the revocation\nevent, only the scoped token is revoked.\n\n* If a domain or a project was renamed, the old name remained in the cache.\nAs a result the old name could be used in some requests until the cache\nrecord expired. For example, the old domain name could still be used for\nauthentication after renaming the domain. Cache entries are now properly\ninvalidated for domain and project rename operations.\n\n* OpenStack Identity did not return the same status and headers for HEAD\nand GET requests, which does not follow the HTTP specification. This would\nlead to different status codes between running keystone-all versus running\nkeystone in Apache httpd with mod_wsgi. The responses have been corrected\nto be consistent regardless of the webserver being used.\n\n* The migration operation that creates the region table did not explicitly\nset the character set to 'utf8'. Consequently, when the database's default\ncharacter set was not set, the db_sync operation failed. The migration\noperation now detects this condition and corrects the database.\n\nRefer to https://launchpad.net/keystone/icehouse/2014.1.2 for more\ninformation on the bug fixes included in version 2014.1.2.1. (BZ#1127434)\n\nAll openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.\n    ",
