A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\ngives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n    ",

				"text": "\nOpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users a graphical\ninterface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.\nThe dashboard allows cloud administrators to get an overall view of the\nsize and state of the cloud and it provides end-users a self-service portal\nto provision their own resources within the limits set by administrators.\n\nA persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the horizon host\naggregate interface. A user with sufficient privileges to add a host\naggregate could potentially use this flaw to capture the credentials of\nanother user. (CVE-2014-3594)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Dennis Felsch and Mario Heiderich from the Horst\nGörtz Institute for IT-Security, Ruhr-University Bochum as the original\nreporters.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the \"Create an Image\" page rendering was blocked\nduring a file upload. This could cause the browser to disconnect after a\ncertain period of time, especially when uploading large files. With this\nupdate, the upload is handled in a separate thread, and large image uploads\nstarted via the web dashboard are less likely to time out and fail.\n(BZ#1089672)\n\n* Creating a user using keystoneclient could fail because keystoneclient\nattempted to create a role for the new user when setting up the user.\nWhen a role already existed, this operation failed and a new user was not\ncreated. This update fixes this bug, and user creation works as expected.\n(BZ#1094494)\n\nAll python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.\n    ",
