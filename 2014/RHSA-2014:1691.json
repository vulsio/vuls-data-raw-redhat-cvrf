This could result in\ndeployments defaulting to having the firewall disabled unless the nova\nconfiguration was manually modified after PackStack was started.\n(CVE-2014-3703)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Yair Fried of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* This update fixes a dependency issue between the openstack-cinder-api and\nopenstack-cinder-backup services. The openstack-cinder-backup service is\nnow guaranteed to be started during PackStack installation. (BZ#1075609)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancements:\n\n* This update enables mysqld performance improvement if users add the\nfollowing configuration options to the /etc/my.cnf file:\n\ninnodb_buffer_pool_size = (10-20% of available memory)\ninnodb_flush_method = O_DIRECT\ninnodb_file_per_table\n\nThese improvements are expected to be the default settings in the next\nrelease. (BZ#1078999)\n\n* With this update, PackStack now consistently performs the installation of\nthe sos, sos-plugins-openstack, and rhos-collector packages on all hosts.\n(BZ#1131619)\n\nAll openstack-packstack users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.\n    ",
