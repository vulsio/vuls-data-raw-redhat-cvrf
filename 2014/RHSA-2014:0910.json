				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that\nprovides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss\nEnterprise Middleware, applications, and services.\n\nThis JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2 release serves as a replacement for\nJBoss Operations Network 3.2.1, and includes several bug fixes. Refer to\nthe JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2 Release Notes for information on the\nmost significant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available\nshortly from https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the implementation of the\norg.picketlink.common.util.DocumentUtil.getDocumentBuilderFactory() method\nprovided a DocumentBuilderFactory that would expand entity references.\nA remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to read files\naccessible to the user running the application server, and potentially\nperform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2014-3530)\n\nIt was found that Mojarra JavaServer Faces did not properly escape\nuser-supplied content in certain circumstances. Contents of outputText tags\nand raw EL expressions that immediately follow script or style elements\nwere not escaped. A remote attacker could use a specially crafted URL to\nexecute arbitrary web script in the user's browser. (CVE-2013-5855)\n\nIt was found that the security audit functionality, provided by JBoss\nOperations Network, logged request parameters in plain text. This may have\ncaused passwords to be included in the audit log files when using BASIC or\nFORM-based authentication. A local attacker with access to audit log files\ncould possibly use this flaw to obtain application or server authentication\ncredentials. Refer to the Solution section of this advisory for additional\ninformation on the fix for this issue. (CVE-2014-0058)\n\nA flaw was found in the WebSocket08FrameDecoder implementation that could\nallow a remote attacker to trigger an Out Of Memory Exception by issuing a\nseries of TextWebSocketFrame and ContinuationWebSocketFrames. Depending on\nthe server configuration, this could lead to a denial of service. (CVE-2014-0193)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Alexander Papadakis for reporting\nCVE-2014-3530, and James Roper of Typesafe for reporting CVE-2014-0193.\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.2.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.2.2.\n    ",
