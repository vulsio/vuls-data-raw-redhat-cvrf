A user with\npermissions to register an endpoint could use this flaw to leak\nconfiguration data, including the master admin_token. Only keystone setups\nthat allow non-cloud-admin users to create endpoints were affected by this\nissue. (CVE-2014-3621)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Brant Knudson from IBM as the original reporter.\n\nThe openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2014.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.\n(BZ#1149748)\n\nAll openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.\n    ",
