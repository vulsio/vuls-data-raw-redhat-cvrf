				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works is the next-generation ESB and business\nprocess automation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works allows\nIT to leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and\nfuture (EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve\nbusiness process execution speed and quality.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Fuse\nService Works 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in the\nREADME file included with the patch files.\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component allowed XSL stylesheets\nto call external Java methods. A remote attacker able to submit messages to\na Camel route could use this flaw to perform arbitrary remote code\nexecution in the context of the Camel server process. (CVE-2014-0003)\n\nIt was found that when JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in\nwhich at least one request contained either multiple content-length\nheaders, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding\nheader, JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting\n(XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.\n(CVE-2013-4286)\n\nIt was found that the Apache Camel XSLT component would resolve entities in\nXML messages when transforming them using an XSLT route. A remote attacker\nable to submit messages to an XSLT Camel route could use this flaw to read\nfiles accessible to the user running the application server and,\npotentially, perform other more advanced XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.\n(CVE-2014-0002)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way Apache Commons FileUpload,\nwhich is embedded in the JBoss Web component of JBoss EAP, handled\nsmall-sized buffers used by MultipartStream. A remote attacker could use\nthis flaw to create a malformed Content-Type header for a multipart\nrequest, causing JBoss Web to enter an infinite loop when processing such\nan incoming request. (CVE-2014-0050)\n\nThe CVE-2014-0002 and CVE-2014-0003 issues were discovered by David Jorm of\nthe Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.\n    ",
