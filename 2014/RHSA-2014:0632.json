				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Web Server is a fully integrated and certified set of\ncomponents for hosting Java web applications. It is comprised of the Apache\nHTTP Server, the Apache Tomcat Servlet container, Apache Tomcat Connector\n(mod_jk), JBoss HTTP Connector (mod_cluster), Hibernate, and the Tomcat\nNative library.\n\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)\nand Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a\nfull-strength, general purpose cryptography library.\n\nIt was found that OpenSSL clients and servers could be forced, via a\nspecially crafted handshake packet, to use weak keying material for\ncommunication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to decrypt\nand modify traffic between a client and a server. (CVE-2014-0224)\n\nNote: In order to exploit this flaw, both the server and the client must be\nusing a vulnerable version of OpenSSL; the server must be using OpenSSL\nversion 1.0.1 and above, and the client must be using any version of\nOpenSSL. Red Hat JBoss Web Server includes OpenSSL 0.9.8e, so this flaw is\nonly exploitable when OpenSSL in JBoss Web Server is used as a client,\ncommunicating with a vulnerable server running OpenSSL version 1.0.1 and\nabove. For more information about this flaw, refer to:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/site/articles/904433\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges KIKUCHI Masashi of Lepidum as the original reporter\nof this issue.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Server 2.0.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update. The Red Hat JBoss Web\nServer process must be restarted for the update to take effect.\n    ",
