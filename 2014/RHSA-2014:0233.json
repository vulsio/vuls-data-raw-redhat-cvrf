				"text": "\nPackStack is a command-line utility that uses Puppet modules to support\nrapid deployment of OpenStack on existing servers over an SSH connection.\nPackStack is suitable for deploying both single node proof-of-concept\ninstallations and more complex multi-node installations.\n\nIt was found that PackStack did not correctly install the rules defined in\nthe default security groups when deployed on OpenStack Networking\n(neutron), allowing network connections to be made to systems that should\nnot have been accessible. (CVE-2014-0071)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, swift's object versioning was disabled by default. With this\nupdate, this feature is now enabled in the default configuration file\n('allow_versions \"true\"' in /etc/swift/container-server.conf). (BZ#967308)\n\n* Previously, it was not possible to run neutron with Open vSwitch using\nVirtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN). This update adds support for VXLAN in\nneutron. (BZ#1021778)\n\n* PackStack failed to complete the deployment of OpenStack due to the\nMongoDB service (mongod) being terminated by systemd. This was because\nmongod, when first started, exceeded the timeout value set by systemd.\nWith this update, mongod uses small files when it is initially started, and\nno longer exceeds systemd's timeout value. (BZ#1036207)\n\n* Previously, services for OpenStack Compute and other OpenStack components\nran in debug mode by default. With this update, the CONFIG_DEBUG_MODE\nconfiguration parameter has been added. When this parameter is set to 'y',\nall OpenStack services will run in debug mode. By default, debug mode is\ndisabled. (BZ#1048041)\n\nNote: Currently, PackStack does not support deployment of the ML2 Neutron\nplug-in. The ML2 plug-in can be used in manual configurations, or by\ndeploying initially with the Open vSwitch plug-in using PackStack and\nconverting the installation to use ML2. This method is described at\nhttp://openstack.redhat.com/Modular_Layer_2_%28ML2%29_Plugin. The progress\non fixing this bug can be followed in Red Hat Bugzilla bug 1017144.\n\nAll openstack-packstack users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.\n    ",
