The JBoss Seam Remoting\ncomponent provides a convenient method of remotely accessing Seam\ncomponents from a web page, using AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML).\n\nIt was found that the ExecutionHandler, PollHandler, and\nSubscriptionHandler classes in JBoss Seam Remoting unmarshalled\nuser-supplied XML and resolved external entities in this XML. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running\nthe application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XML\nExternal Entity (XXE) attacks. (CVE-2013-6447)\n\nIt was found that the InterfaceGenerator handler in JBoss Seam Remoting\nexposed details of all classes and methods on the server's classpath, not\nonly methods with the org.jboss.seam.annotations.remoting.WebRemote\nannotation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to determine which\nclasses are deployed on the JBoss server. (CVE-2013-6448)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Jon Passki of Coverity SRL for reporting these\nissues.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.4.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.
