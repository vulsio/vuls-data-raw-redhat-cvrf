				"text": "\nOpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and\ndelivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to\ncopy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away.\nStored images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running\nquickly and more consistently than installing a server operating system and\nindividually configuring additional services.\n\nIt was found that Sheepdog, a distributed object storage system, did not\nproperly validate Sheepdog image URIs. A remote attacker able to insert or\nmodify glance image metadata could use this flaw to execute arbitrary\ncommands with the privileges of the user running the glance service.\nNote that only OpenStack Image setups using the Sheepdog back end were\naffected. (CVE-2014-0162)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Paul McMillan (Nebula) as the original reporter.\n\nAll users of openstack-glance are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct this issue. After installing the updated packages,\nthe running glance services will be restarted automatically.\n    ",
