				"text": "\nOpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual\nmachines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.\nCompute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to\norchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing\nnetworks, and controlling access through users and projects.\n\nIt was found that overwriting the disk inside of an instance with a\nmalicious image, and then switching the instance to rescue mode, could\npotentially allow an authenticated user to access arbitrary files on the\ncompute host depending on the file permissions and SELinux constraints of\nthose files. Only setups that used libvirt to spawn instances and which had\nthe use of cow images disabled (\"use_cow_images = False\" in nova\nconfiguration) were affected. (CVE-2014-0134)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Stanislaw Pitucha from Hewlett Packard as the\noriginal reporter.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* The Compute libguestfs did not perform tear down correctly in certain\ncases, such as when attempting to perform SSH key injection when no SSH\nkeys were specified. As a result, libguestfs qemu instances would remain\nrunning, even after the Compute instance with which they were associated\nwas destroyed. This has been fixed and now tear down of libguestfs occurs\ncorrectly. (BZ#1022627)\n\n* Qpid's driver reconnection delay is not configurable. This and the fact\nthat the hard-coded delay was quite high became a blocker issue from an HA\nperspective. Making this value configurable is not possible for this\nversion, so the hard-coded delay was changed. The new delay cap is 5\nseconds. (BZ#1060772)\n\n* Nova was creating a temporary VMware snapshot during a nova snapshot, but\nnot deleting it on completion. Thus VMware guests could end up with a large\nnumber of unnecessary snapshots. The temporary VMware snapshot is now\ndeleted on completion of the nova snapshot operation. (BZ#1069429)\n\n* The Nova vmware driver was not passing the iscsi server location to the\ninstance, hence it was not possible to add a cinder iscsi disk to a VMware\ninstance. The nova vmware driver now correctly passes the iscsi server\nlocation to the instance and it is possible to add a cinder iscsi disk to a\nVMware instance. (BZ#1069432)\n\n* The nova VMware driver was assigning VNC ports in a way which could cause\ncollisions between guests. There was a small chance that 2 instances could\nbe created with the same VNC port. If both instances ran on the same ESX\nhost, only one of their consoles would be available. However, that console\nwould be presented when requested for both instances. This has been fixed\nso that the nova VMware driver now allocates VNC ports which are unique to\na vcenter, and a user of one instance will not be presented with the\nconsole of another. (BZ#1077017)\n\nEnhancement:\n\n* When troubleshooting production systems it is desirable to be able to\ntrace all data base queries, web REST calls, messaging service RPC calls,\nand libvirt API calls associated with invocation of a user command or\nbackground job. Hence, the ability has been added to obtain a debug dump of\nthe system state for an OpenStack service based process. For example, upon\nsending SIGUSR1, a dump of all native threads, green threads, live\nconfiguration, and any other relevant info is triggered. (BZ#1071469)\n\nAll openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct these issues and add this enhancement.\n    ",
