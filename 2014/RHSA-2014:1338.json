				"text": "\nOpenStack Image service (glance) provides discovery, registration, and\ndelivery services for disk and server images. It provides the ability to\ncopy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. Stored\nimages can be used as a template to get new servers up and running quickly\nand more consistently than installing a server operating system and\nindividually configuring additional services.\n\nIt was discovered that the image_size_cap configuration option in glance\nwas not honored. An authenticated user could use this flaw to upload an\nimage to glance and consume all available storage space, resulting in a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2014-5356)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Whenever the 'x-image-meta-store' header was passed to glance-api, the\nservice would check whether the value was a valid store instead of a valid\nscheme. However, the rest of the store library uses the scheme to identify\nthe store that should be used; this prevented the use of this feature.\nGlance now verifies that the value of 'x-image-meta-store' is a valid\nscheme instead of a valid store name. (BZ#1134249)\n\n* With this update, Image Service (glance) is now dependent on oslo.vmware\nin order to support the optional VMware store. This hard dependency was\ncreated due to the likelihood that the dependencies are already installed\nand due to the diminutive size of the package. As a result, the user\nexperience is improved by no longer requiring a manual oslo.vmware\ninstall. (BZ#1125876)\n\n* Previously, the process of upgrading from Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nOpenStack Platform 4 to 5 may have failed. (BZ#1139243)\n\nAll openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.\n    ",
