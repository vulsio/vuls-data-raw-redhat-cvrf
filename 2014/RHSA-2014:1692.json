				"text": "\nOpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),\nTransport Layer Security (TLS), and Datagram Transport Layer Security\n(DTLS) protocols, as well as a full-strength, general purpose cryptography\nlibrary.\n\nThis update adds support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value\n(TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV), which can be used to prevent protocol downgrade\nattacks against applications which re-connect using a lower SSL/TLS\nprotocol version when the initial connection indicating the highest\nsupported protocol version fails.\n\nThis can prevent a forceful downgrade of the communication to SSL 3.0.\nThe SSL 3.0 protocol was found to be vulnerable to the padding oracle\nattack when using block cipher suites in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.\nThis issue is identified as CVE-2014-3566, and also known under the alias\nPOODLE. This SSL 3.0 protocol flaw will not be addressed in a future\nupdate; it is recommended that users configure their applications to\nrequire at least TLS protocol version 1.0 for secure communication.\n\nFor additional information about this flaw, see the Knowledgebase article\nat https://access.redhat.com/articles/1232123\n\nA memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed the DTLS Secure\nReal-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) extension data. A remote attacker could\nsend multiple specially crafted handshake messages to exhaust all available\nmemory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server. (CVE-2014-3513)\n\nA memory leak flaw was found in the way an OpenSSL handled failed session\nticket integrity checks. A remote attacker could exhaust all available\nmemory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server by sending a large number of invalid\nsession tickets to that server. (CVE-2014-3567)\n\nAll OpenSSL users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to mitigate the CVE-2014-3566 issue and correct\nthe CVE-2014-3513 and CVE-2014-3567 issues. For the update to take effect,\nall services linked to the OpenSSL library (such as httpd and other\nSSL-enabled services) must be restarted or the system rebooted.\n    ",
