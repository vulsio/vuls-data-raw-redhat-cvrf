An authenticated user could use this flaw to gain\nunauthorized console access to instances belonging to other tenants by\nrepeatedly spawning new instances. Note that only nova setups using the\nVMware driver and the VNC proxy service were affected. (CVE-2014-8750)\n\nThe openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2013.2.4, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the\nprevious version. (BZ#1146086)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Prior to this update, certain RPC messages were not sending the correct\ndata format when the version cap was set. During a live upgrade from Red\nHat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0 to Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nOpenStack Platform 5.0, when there were Compute nodes running different\nversions of the code, some operations would fail on the Compute hosts that\nwere not upgraded. With this update, proper version of the data is sent in\nall cases, and all RPC calls succeed during the live migration.\n(BZ#1083625)\n\nAll openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct these issues and add these enhancements.\n    ",
