				"text": "\nThe Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager data warehouse package\nprovides the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process and database scripts to\ncreate a historic database API. It also provides SQL BI reports creation\nfor management and monitoring.\n\nIt was found that the ovirt-engine-dwh setup script logged the history\ndatabase password in plain text to a world-readable file. An attacker with\na local user account on the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager\nserver could use this flaw to access, read, and modify the reports\ndatabase. (CVE-2014-0202)\n\nNote: Applying the update provided by this advisory does not modify any\nexisting log files. It is recommended that you search your existing log\nfiles and remove any occurrences of plain text passwords manually.\n\nThis issue was discovered by Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the read-only user and custom users for the data warehouse\ndatabase would lose access to views in the database when the database was\nupgraded. This was caused by the views being regenerated when the database\nwas upgraded and the permissions for those views not being applied to the\nnewly generated views. Now, user permissions are retained when the database\nis upgraded. (BZ#1078129)\n\n* Previously, the ovirt-engine-dwh-setup command would fail under certain\nconditions if the pg_hba.conf file had been manually edited prior to\nrunning that command. This was caused by the setup process checking the\nexact number of spaces in between values on the line corresponding to\n'local'. Now, the logic for checking the values in that line has been\nrevised so that the setup process can correctly read all values regardless\nof the number of spaces. (BZ#1084760)\n\nAll rhevm-dwh users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncorrects these issues.\n    ",
