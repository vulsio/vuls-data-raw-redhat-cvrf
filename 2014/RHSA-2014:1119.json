				"text": "\nOpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven\nsystem that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main\nfunction is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red\nHat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'\nas the core component of OpenStack Networking.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in neutron's handling of allowed address\npairs. As there was no enforced quota on the amount of allowed address\npairs, a sufficiently authorized user could possibly create a large number\nof firewall rules, impacting performance or potentially rendering a compute\nnode unusable. (CVE-2014-3555)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Liping Mao from Cisco as the original reporter.\n\nThe openstack-neutron packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2014.1.2, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the\nprevious version, most notable of which are:\n\n* Multiple Open vSwitch agent fixes: the agent now sets bridges in the\ncorrect order to avoid breaking tunnel networks, creates the integration\nbridge if it is missing, sets the secure-failing mode for integration\nbridges to ensure the 'openvswitch' service does not program NORMAL action\non restart and instead relies on L2 agent to manage those bridges on\nrestart, limits veth names to 15 characters, and no longer spawns RPC\nconsumers before all the needed data structures are ready to be accessed.\n\n* RPC interactions between the DHCP agent and the Neutron plug-in have\nbeen optimized.\n\n* Rule updates for security groups are now applied more effectively.\n\n* Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS): a possible race condition when deleting a\nfirewall has been fixed; iptables updates are no longer deferred for the\nservice.\n\n* Metering: metering data for egress and ingress are now reported\nseparately; incorrect router key used to report against MongoDB has\nbeen fixed.\n\n* Load-Balancing-as-a-Service (LBaaS): resources are now registered against\nquotas engine; rootwrap filters are now shipped independent of L3 agent\nfilters.\n\n* Metaplugin now supports multiple RPC workers.\n\n* The following plug-ins have been updated: BigSwitch, Brocade, Cisco N1k,\nHyperV, OFAgent, PLUMgrid, and VMWare NSX.\n\nRefer to https://launchpad.net/neutron/icehouse/2014.1.2 for more\ninformation on the changes included in the 2014.1.2 of openstack-neutron.\n(BZ#1127439)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, OpenStack Networking could stop processing network ports that\ndisappeared from the integration bridge during the L2-agent loop, even\nafter those ports were back on the bridge. As a result, updates for\ntemporarily disappeared ports were not handled by the L2 agent. With this\nupdate, these ports are no longer marked as processed if not found on the\nintegration bridge. Ports are now processed correctly even after they\ntemporarily disappear from the integration bridge. (BZ#1115588)\n\nAll openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.\n    ",
