				"text": "\nOpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual\nmachines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.\nCompute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to\norchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances, managing\nnetworks, and controlling access through users and projects.\n\nIt was discovered that the metadata agent in OpenStack Networking was\nmissing an authorization check on the device ID that is bound to a specific\nport. A remote tenant could guess the instance ID bound to a port and\nretrieve metadata of another tenant, resulting in information disclosure.\nNote that only OpenStack Networking setups running neutron-metadata-agent\nwere affected. (CVE-2013-6419)\n\nIt was found that nova used directories that were writable to by all local\nusers to temporarily store live snapshots. A local attacker with access to\nsuch a directory could use this flaw to read and modify the contents of\nlive snapshots. (CVE-2013-7048)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the libvirt driver handled short-lived disk\nback-up files on Compute nodes. An authenticated attacker could use this\nflaw to create a large number of such files, exhausting all available space\non Compute node disks, and potentially causing a denial of service.\nNote that only Compute setups using the libvirt driver were affected.\n(CVE-2013-6437)\n\nIt was discovered that the libvirt driver did not properly handle live\nmigration of virtual machines. An authenticated attacker could use this\nflaw to gain access to a snapshot of a migrated virtual machine. Note that\nonly setups using KVM live block migration were affected. (CVE-2013-7130)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting\nCVE-2013-6419, CVE-2013-6437, and CVE-2013-7130. Upstream acknowledges\nAaron Rosen of VMware as the original reporter of CVE-2013-6419, Phil Day\nfrom HP as the original reporter of CVE-2013-6437, and Loganathan Parthipan\nas the original reporter of CVE-2013-7130.\n\nThese updated openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream\nversion 2013.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous\nversion. (BZ#1065317)\n\nBug fixes:\n\n* The GlusterFS volume connector in nova did not pass a port to libvirt for\nthe GlusterFS disk specification. Attaching a volume failed with a libvirt\nerror indicating the port field was missing. This update fixes this bug by\nproviding the default Gluster port in nova. (BZ#1020979)\n\n* The database back end did not handle the 2013 MySQL error code (Lost\nconnection). The 2013 MySQL error code has been added to the collection of\nknown database error codes. (BZ#1060771)\n\n* OpenStack Compute set the smbios product/vendor information to OpenStack\nvalues, which Red Hat Satellite 5 did not recognize when processing\nentitlements. (BZ#1059414)\n\n* Prior to this update, nova-api did not pass the absolute path of the\nconfiguration file to the api-paste library if a file with the same name\nwas found in the current directory. (BZ#1039554)\n\n* The definition of the libvirt_info method in the RBD back-end class was\nmissing a positional argument that the base class defined. (BZ#1063445)\n\n* Rebooting a host caused all of its instances to stop and change to the\nSHUTDOWN power state. The unpause action was only allowed on instances with\nthe PAUSED power state. (BZ#1047863)\n\n* The previous default of writing zeros over deleted volumes took a\nsignificant amount of time. It is now possible to set a global\nconfiguration setting to clear only a part of a volume, or to disable\nclearing completely. Additionally, a new 'shred' capability is available to\noverwrite volumes with random data instead of zeros. (BZ#1062377)\n\n* In OpenStack Compute, low-level QPID debug log messages are no longer\nshown by default. These previously appeared due to the 'level=debug'\nparameter set in the nova.conf file. (BZ#1047849)\n\nAll openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct these issues.\n    ",
