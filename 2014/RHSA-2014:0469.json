				"text": "\nRed Hat CloudForms Management Engine delivers the insight, control, and\nautomation needed to address the challenges of managing virtual\nenvironments.\n\nA flaw was found in the way Ruby on Rails' actionpack rubygem performed\nJSON parameter parsing. An application using a third party library, which\nuses the Rack::Request interface, or custom Rack middleware could bypass\nthe protection implemented to fix the CVE-2013-0155 vulnerability, causing\nthe application to receive unsafe parameters and become vulnerable to\nCVE-2013-0155. (CVE-2013-6417)\n\nAn input sanitization flaw was found in the saved_report_delete action in\nthe ReportController. An authenticated Management Engine user could use\nthis flaw to perform an SQL injection attack on the Management Engine back\nend database. (CVE-2014-0137)\n\nIt was found that Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine did not properly\ncheck user role permissions for actions associated with catalogs.\nAn authenticated Management Engine user could use this flaw to delete\narbitrary catalogs regardless of the granted permissions. (CVE-2014-0078)\n\nMultiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the date/time\nimplementation of PostgreSQL. An authenticated database user could provide\na specially crafted date/time value that, when processed, could cause\nPostgreSQL to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the\npermissions of the user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0063)\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,\nwere found in various type input functions in PostgreSQL. An authenticated\ndatabase user could possibly use these flaws to crash PostgreSQL or,\npotentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user\nrunning PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0064, CVE-2014-2669)\n\nMultiple potential buffer overflow flaws were found in PostgreSQL.\nAn authenticated database user could possibly use these flaws to crash\nPostgreSQL or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of\nthe user running PostgreSQL. (CVE-2014-0065)\n\nIt was found that granting an SQL role to a database user in a PostgreSQL\ndatabase without specifying the \"ADMIN\" option allowed the grantee to\nremove other users from their granted role. An authenticated database user\ncould use this flaw to remove a user from an SQL role which they were\ngranted access to. (CVE-2014-0060)\n\nA flaw was found in the validator functions provided by PostgreSQL's\nprocedural languages. An authenticated database user could possibly use\nthis flaw to escalate their privileges. (CVE-2014-0061)\n\nA race condition was found in the way PostgreSQL's CREATE INDEX command\nperformed multiple independent lookups of a table that had to be indexed.\nAn authenticated database user could possibly use this flaw to escalate\ntheir privileges. (CVE-2014-0062)\n\nIt was found that the chkpass extension of PostgreSQL did not check the\nreturn value of the crypt() function. An authenticated database user could\npossibly use this flaw to crash PostgreSQL via a null pointer dereference.\n(CVE-2014-0066)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Ruby on Rails project for reporting\nCVE-2013-6417; upstream acknowledges Sudhir Rao as the original reporter\nof this issue.\n\nRed Hat would also like to thank the PostgreSQL project for reporting\nCVE-2014-0060, CVE-2014-0061, CVE-2014-0062, CVE-2014-0063, CVE-2014-0064,\nCVE-2014-0065, CVE-2014-0066, and CVE-2014-2669; upstream acknowledges Noah\nMisch, Heikki Linnakangas, Peter Eisentraut, Jozef Mlich, Andres Freund,\nRobert Haas, Honza Horak, and Bruce Momjian as the original reporters of\nthese issues.\n\nThe CVE-2014-0137 and CVE-2014-0078 issues were discovered by Jan Rusnacko\nof the Red Hat Product Security Team.\n    ",
