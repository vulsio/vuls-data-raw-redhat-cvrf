				"text": "\nOpenStack Networking (neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven\nsystem that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main\nfunction is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines. As of Red\nHat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4.0, 'neutron' replaces 'quantum'\nas the core component of OpenStack Networking.\n\nIt was discovered that the openstack-neutron package in Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux Open Stack Platform 5.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was released\nwith a sudoers file containing a configuration error. This error caused\nOpenStack Networking to be vulnerable to the CVE-2013-6433 issue.\n(CVE-2014-3632)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the Open vSwitch agent failed to process ports on\nthe integration bridge that quickly disappeared and reappeared during the\nprocessing loop. When such a failure occurred, the processing of the port\nwas aborted (which is the correct behavior), but it was also marked as\nprocessed, meaning that the next updates for the port were not applied when\nit reappeared later. As a consequence, some ports were not VLAN-tagged\ncorrectly, and that resulted in no network connectivity for those instances\nthat were bound to those ports. With this update, ports that are not on the\nintegration bridge are still not processed but also not marked as such.\nPorts that disappear and then reappear later on the integration bridge are\nprocessed correctly, and VLAN tag updates are properly applied.\n(BZ#1123053)\n\n* This update fixes an issue that caused connectivity to be dropped when\nrestarting the openvswitch service with l2pop enabled. (BZ#1120719)\n\n* Due to an incorrect version of the python-httplib2 package specified in\nthe spec file, when a large amount of virtual machines (VMs) was launched,\nsome of the VMs could be assigned two private IP addresses. (BZ#1126451)\n\nAll openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.\n    ",
