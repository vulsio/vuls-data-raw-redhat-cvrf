				"text": "\nThe openstack-heat packages provide heat, a Python implementation of the\nOpenStack Orchestration engine, to launch multiple composite cloud\napplications based on templates.\n\nIt was found that heat did not properly enforce cloudformation-compatible\nAPI policy rules. An in-instance attacker could use the CreateStack or\nUpdateStack methods to create or update a stack, resulting in a violation\nof the API policy. Note that only setups using Orchestration's\ncloudformation-compatible API were affected. (CVE-2013-6426)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Orchestration's REST API implementation handled\nmodified request paths. An authenticated remote user could use this flaw to\nbypass the tenant-scoping restriction by modifying the request path,\nresulting in privilege escalation. Note that only setups using\nOrchestration's cloudformation-compatible API were affected.\n(CVE-2013-6428)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for\nreporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Steven Hardy of Red Hat as\nthe original reporter.\n\nThe openstack-heat packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2013.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the\nprevious version. The most notable fixes and enhancements are:\n\n- Auto-scaling has been fixed when AdjustmentType was set to\n  PercentChangeInCapacity.\n\n- A QPID broker restart no longer permanently disrupts subscribed clients.\n\n- RPC requests are now only serviced by one server in a given topic group.\n\n- Auto-scaling group growth or shrinkage has been fixed to utilize the full\n  available size, regardless of the scaling policy adjustment.\n\n(BZ#1045430)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The outdated heat-db-setup tool, which only supported local installs, has\nbeen removed. The Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform 4\nInstallation and Configuration Guide has been updated to show how to create\nthe necessary database and associated tables for Orchestration, allowing\nthe deployment of the database server on a local or remote system (see\nInstalling the OpenStack Orchestration Service). (BZ#1046326)\n\n* The heat-engine source code had a hard-coded reference to a Fedora image\nname in the implementation of the AWS-compatible LoadBalancer resource.\nThis meant that you could not specify an alternative LoadBalancer image\nname in deployments (for example, Red Hat Enterprise Linux). A new option\nhas been added to the Orchestration configuration file,\n/etc/heat/heat.conf, which is named loadbalancer_template. The new\nloadbalancer_template option can now be used to specify an alternate\nLoadBalancer template that contains a different image name. (BZ#1048215)\n\n* Due to a packaging error, the heat-manage tool was not working properly\n(which prohibited a successful database creation). This error has been\nfixed by moving the parallel package selection code so that all\nOrchestration tools now use the proper packages for use at runtime.\n(BZ#1048335)\n\nAll openstack-heat users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct these issues and add these enhancements.\n    ",
