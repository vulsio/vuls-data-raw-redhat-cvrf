				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works is the next-generation ESB and business\nprocess automation infrastructure.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Fuse\nService Works 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in the\nREADME file included with the patch files.\n\nThe following security issues are fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had\ninsufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.\nA remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language\nTransformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using\nXalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the\nsecure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the\nclasspath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the\ncontext of the application server running the application that uses\nXalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)\n\nIt was found that the ParserPool and Decrypter classes in the OpenSAML Java\nimplementation resolved external entities, permitting XML External Entity\n(XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files\naccessible to the user running the application server, and potentially\nperform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6440)\n\nIt was found that Java Security Manager permissions configured via a policy\nfile were not properly applied, causing all deployed applications to be\ngranted the java.security.AllPermission permission. In certain cases, an\nattacker could use this flaw to circumvent expected security measures to\nperform actions which would otherwise be restricted. (CVE-2014-0093)\n\nThe HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable file name\nin /tmp/ when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no\ncustom library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these\nnative libraries with malicious versions during the window between when\nHawtJNI writes them and when they are executed. (CVE-2013-2035)\n\nIn Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, when running under a\nsecurity manager, it was possible for deployed code to get access to the\nModular Service Container (MSC) service registry without any permission\nchecks. This could allow malicious deployments to modify the internal state\nof the server in various ways. (CVE-2014-0018)\n\nIt was found that the security audit functionality logged request\nparameters in plain text. This may have caused passwords to be included in\nthe audit log files when using BASIC or FORM-based authentication. A local\nattacker with access to audit log files could possibly use this flaw to\nobtain application or server authentication credentials. (CVE-2014-0058)\n\nThe CVE-2013-6440 issue was discovered by David Illsley, Ron Gutierrez of\nGotham Digital Science, and David Jorm of Red Hat Product Security; the\nCVE-2014-0093 issue was discovered by Josef Cacek of the Red Hat JBoss EAP\nQuality Engineering team; the CVE-2013-2035 issue was discovered by Florian\nWeimer of Red Hat Product Security; and the CVE-2014-0018 issue was\ndiscovered by Stuart Douglas of Red Hat.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.\n    ",
