JBoss Data Virtualization makes data\nspread across physically distinct systems—such as multiple databases, XML\nfiles, and even Hadoop systems—appear as a set of tables in a local\ndatabase.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss Data\nVirtualization 6.0.0. It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in\nthe README file included with the patch files.\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that when JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in\nwhich at least one request contained either multiple content-length\nheaders, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding\nheader, JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker\ncould use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting\n(XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.\n(CVE-2013-4286)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.0.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.\n    ",
