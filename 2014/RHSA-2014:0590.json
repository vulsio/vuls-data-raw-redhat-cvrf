				"text": "\nJBoss Enterprise Application Platform is a platform for Java applications,\nwhich integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and\nJBoss Seam.\n\nIt was found that the secure processing feature of Xalan-Java had\ninsufficient restrictions defined for certain properties and features.\nA remote attacker able to provide Extensible Stylesheet Language\nTransformations (XSLT) content to be processed by an application using\nXalan-Java could use this flaw to bypass the intended constraints of the\nsecure processing feature. Depending on the components available in the\nclasspath, this could lead to arbitrary remote code execution in the\ncontext of the application server running the application that uses\nXalan-Java. (CVE-2014-0107)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\nIt was observed that when using the Transfomer to convert a StreamSource to\nDOMResult, the performance of the conversion degraded as the size of the\ncharacter data increased. For example, converting a 50 MB XML BLOB would\ntake a very long time to finish. This issue has been resolved in this\nrelease by adjusting both the SAX2DOM and DOMBuilder classes to handle\nlarger inputs more efficiently. (JBPAPP-10991)\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.2.0 as provided from\nthe Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update. The JBoss\nserver process must be restarted for this update to take effect.\n    ",
