				"text": "\nThe openstack-keystone packages provide keystone, a Python implementation\nof the OpenStack Identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,\nCatalog, and Policy services.\n\nIt was found that the ec2token API in keystone, which is used to generate\nEC2-style (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) credentials, could generate a\ntoken not scoped to a particular trust when creating a token from a\nreceived trust-scoped token. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nretrieve a token that elevated their privileges to all of the trustor's\nroles. Note that only OpenStack Identity setups that have EC2-style\nauthentication enabled were affected. (CVE-2013-6391)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Jeremy Stanley of the OpenStack Project for\nreporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Steven Hardy of Red Hat as the\noriginal reporter.\n\nThese updated packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2013.2.1,\nwhich provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.\n(BZ#1045408)\n\nAll openstack-keystone users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.\n    ",
