This\nwas solved by giving Ghostscript a 'PARANOIDSAFER' mode, which will not\nopen external files.\n\nA foomatic printing database bug, which caused all users of the 'stp'\ndriver, including virtually all Epson printers, to fail to print as a\nresult of miscalculated driver data.\n\nA filtration problem, which caused many PCL and PJL printers to produce\ngarbage. This was solved by switching to the foomatic distributed\n'lpdomatic' program for filtration.\n\nA few printconf crashers in the new printconf-tui programme.\n\nAnd in addition, this update adds the Omni print drivers from IBM, which\nsupport an additional 300 printers.\n    ",

						"text": "\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe\ndesired RPMs.\n\nAfter updating the rpms, you will need to restart your print server, by\nrunning:\n\n/sbin/service lpd restart\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
