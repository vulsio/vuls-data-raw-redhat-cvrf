The original\npackages detected the availability of syscalls present in kernels newer\nthan 2.2. Red Hat Linux 5.2 has a 2.0 kernel, and users will experience\nvarious problems when these syscalls are used. This release removes the\ndetection of these syscalls from the autoconf script.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
