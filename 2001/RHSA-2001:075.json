				"text": "\nXinetd is a secure replacement for inetd, the Internet services daemon.\nXinetd provides access control for all services based on the address of the\nremote host or on time of access and can prevent denial-of-access attacks.\nXinetd provides extensive logging, has no limit on the number of server\narguments, and lets you bind specific services to specific IP addresses on\nyour host machine. Each service has its own specific configuration file for\nXinetd; the files are located in the /etc/xinetd.d directory.\n\nPreviously, xinetd ran with umask 0, which meant that applications using\nthe xinetd umask that did not set permissions themselves created\nworld-writable files. This update sets the default umask to 022. \n\nAlso, the web interface for linuxconf did not work in Red Hat Linux 7.1.\nOther minor issues have also been addressed.\n\nUsers of xinetd should upgrade to this updated package, which resolves\nthese issues.\n    ",
