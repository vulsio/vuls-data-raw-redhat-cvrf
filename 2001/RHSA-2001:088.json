It is recommended that users of Netscape\nand plugger update to the fixed xloadimage packages.\n\nPlugger was shipped in Red Hat Powertools 6.2; if you have\nonly installed packages from Red Hat Linux 6.2, you are not vulnerable\nto this exploit.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
