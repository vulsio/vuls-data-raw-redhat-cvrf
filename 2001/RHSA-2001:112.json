Ghostscript, a\npostscript interpreter, can read arbitrary system files with the same\npermissions as the print spooler, potentially exposing the system to an\ninformation compromise.\n    ",

				"text": "\nGhostscript, a postscript interpreter, possess various 'file', 'run',\netc., commands internally. It also provides a -dSAFER flag to restrict the\nuse of the commands. However, the -dSAFER flag is meant to protect a user\nfrom malicious postscript, not to protect a system from inappropriate\nsnooping by a user, and so it is still possible to _read_ files in the\nSAFER mode.\n\nIn a print spooling context, even reading arbitrary files is dangerous, and\nso this needs to be disabled in that context.\n\n[UPDATE] : previous versions of this errata used packages:\nrhs-printfilters-1.46-6,\nrhs-printfilters-1.63-2.rh6.2,\nrhs-printfilters-1.63-2.rh6.2j,\nrhs-printfilters-1.81-2.rh7.0, and\nrhs-printfilters-1.81-2.rh7.0j.\n\nThese caused spools to break upon upgrade, though they could easily be fixed\nby editing the spools with printtool. The updated versions of the errata\npackages address this bug.\n\n[update Dec 14th, 2001]\nThe errata for Red Hat Linux for Japanese, version 7.0J, requires the\nghostscript package available for the 7.1 release.\n    ",
