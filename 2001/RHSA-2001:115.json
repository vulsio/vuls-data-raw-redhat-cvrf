Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe desired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this to be an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat\nNetwork, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nAfter you have updated the packages, you must restart zope:\n\n  /etc/rc.d/init.d/zope restart\n    ",
