						"text": "\nIf you have not installed:\n--------------------------\n\nDownload the update disk image and create an update disk. This can be\ndone by using the same procedure used to create a boot diskette.\n\nFor more information, refer to\n\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-7.1-Manual/install-guide/s1-steps-install-cdrom.html#S2-STEPS-MAKE-DISKS\n\nPlease note that you must substitute the update disk image filename for the\nfilename used in the example.\n\nWhen booting into the installation program, type \"linux updates\"\nat the boot prompt, followed by any other installation options (such as\n\"expert\" or \"text\" or \"ks\"). The installation process\nwill prompt you to insert the update disk when it is required, and the\ninstallation will then proceed as normal.\n\nIf you have already installed:\n------------------------------\nCheck the permissions on the affected files and change them as appropriate.\nOr install the upgraded redhat-release; this will change the the\npermissions during its postinstall phase.\n\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe desired RPMs.\n    ",
