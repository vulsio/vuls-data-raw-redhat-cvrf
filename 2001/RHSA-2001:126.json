Because mm and expat were not previously\nreleased for Red Hat Linux 7, and mm was not previously released for Red\nHat Linux 7.1, they will need to either be installed simultaneously with or\nbefore the apache packages.\n\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.  Users of Red Hat Linux 7 and\n7.1 will find that the mod_bandwidth, mod_put, and mod_throttle packages\nare now built as separate packages, and that they will need to manually\ninstall these packages as well.\n\nTo update all other RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Administrators who have configured their servers to run CGI\nscripts from user home directories should read the suexec documentation\nincluded in the apache-manual package.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
