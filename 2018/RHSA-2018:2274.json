				"text": "\nRed Hat Ceph Storage is a scalable, open, software-defined storage platform\nthat combines the most stable version of the Ceph storage system with a\nCeph management platform, deployment utilities, and support services.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* ceph: cephx protocol is vulnerable to replay attack (CVE-2018-1128)\n\n* ceph: cephx uses weak signatures (CVE-2018-1129)\n\n* ceph: ceph-mon does not perform authorization on OSD pool ops (CVE-2018-10861)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS\nscore and other related information refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the\nReference section.\n\nEnhancement(s):\n\n* Ceph OSDs now log when they shutdown due to disk operations timing out by\ndefault. (BZ#1568897)\n\n* The `radosgw-admin orphans find` command can inadvertently remove data objects still in use, if followed by another operation, such as, a `rados rm` command. Users are now warned before attempting to produce lists of potentially orphaned objects. (BZ#1573656)\n\n* The 'ceph-osdomap-tool' now has a 'compact' command to perform offline\ncompaction on an OSD's 'omap' directory. (BZ#1574231)\n\n* For S3 and Swift protocols, an option to list buckets/containers in natural (partial) order has been added. Listing containers in sorted order is canonical in both protocols, but is costly, and not required by some client applications. The performance and workload cost of S3 and Swift bucket/container listings is reduced for sharded buckets/containers when the `allow_unordered` extension is used. (BZ#1595374)\n\n* An asynchronous mechanism for executing the Ceph Object Gateway garbage collection using the `librados` APIs has been introduced. The original garbage collection mechanism serialized all processing, and lagged behind applications in specific workloads. Garbage collection performance has been significantly improved, and can be tuned to specific site requirements. (BZ#1595383)\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\nThese updated Ceph packages include numerous bug fixes. Space precludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are directed to the Red Hat Ceph Storage 2.5 Release Notes for information on the most significant bug fixes for this release:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_ceph_storage/2.5/html/release_notes/bug_fixes\n    ",
