				"text": "\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform director provides the facilities for deploying\nand monitoring a private or public infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud\nbased on Red Hat OpenStack Platform.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A resource-permission flaw was found in the python-tripleo and openstack-tripleo-heat-templates packages where ceph.client.openstack.keyring is created as world-readable. A local attacker with access to the key could read or modify data on Ceph cluster pools for OpenStack as though the attacker were the OpenStack service, thus potentially reading or modifying data in an OpenStack Block Storage volume. \n\nTo exploit this flaw, the attacker must have local access to an overcloud node. However by default, access to overcloud nodes is restricted and accessible only from the management undercloud server on an internal network. (CVE-2017-12155)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Katuya Kawakami (NEC).\n\n* It was discovered that the memcached connections using UDP transport protocol can be abused for efficient traffic amplification distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A remote attacker could send a malicious UDP request using a spoofed source IP address of a target system to memcached, causing it to send a significantly larger response to the target. (CVE-2018-1000115)\n\nThis update also includes the following bug fixes and enhancements:\n\n* Prior to this update, when removing the ceph-osd RPM from overcloud nodes that do not require the package, the corresponding Ceph OSD product key was not removed. Consequently, the subscription-manager would incorrectly report that the Ceph OSD product was still installed.\nWith this update, the script that handles removal of the ceph-osd RPM now also removes the Ceph OSD product key. Note: The script that removes the RPM and product key executes only during the overcloud update procedure; the product key is removed only when the overcloud node is updated.\nAs a result, after removing the ceph-osd RPM, the subscription-manager no longer reports the Ceph OSD product is installed. (BZ#1571436)\n\n* Previously, there were errors in the director Heat template that configures the VMAX Cinder backend driver. Consequently, the VMAX driver would not function correctly. With this update, the errors have been corrected, and the VMAX driver functions correctly. (BZ#1546799)\n\n* This enhancement adds director support for deploying the Dell EMC VMAX cinder backend. (BZ#1546793)\n\n* In this enhancement, if a minor update is blocked by an existing yum process that prevents the package update, the process should exit with an appropriate error message. This was added because the minor update may appear to freeze, due to yum waiting for the existing yum.pid to exit; when it eventually fails it is not immediately clear why. As a result, if there is an existing yum process preventing the package update, then the minor update fails with a clear message to indicate this: \"ERROR existing yum.pid detected - can't continue! Please ensure there is no other package update process for the duration of the minor update worfklow. Exiting\". (BZ#1471721)\n    ",
