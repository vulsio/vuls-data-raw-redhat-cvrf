				"text": "\nThe RHN service for Satellite 5.7, 5.6, and earlier versions of Satellite 5 will exit the existing Limited Maintenance Release phase and be permanently shut down on January 31, 2019.\n\nAfter this date, for the affected Satellite 5 versions:\n\n* No content will be available from RHN. Both system level updates and channel synchronization will be stopped as a result;\n\n* No Satellite certificates for these versions will be generated or provided for these EOL product versions;\n\n* As per the life-cycle support policy for Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat will discontinue technical support services as well as software maintenance services;\n\n* New bug fixes, security updates, and product enhancements will no longer be provided.\n\nDetails of the Satellite support policy can be found at:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/satellite/\n\nNotes:\n\n1) Red Hat will continue to support Red Hat Satellite and Proxy version 5.8.\n\n2) Red Hat Satellite 5.6 and Red Hat Satellite 5.7 will be EOL on January 31, 2019. They will have to be upgraded.\n\nHow to proceed:\n\n* Plan to upgrade to a newer version prior to January 31, 2019. You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to Red Hat Satellite 5.8 immediately, which will be supported through May 31, 2020. You are also encouraged to plan a longer-term transition to Satellite 6, but to first ensure all Satellite and Proxy versions 5.7 and earlier have been upgraded prior to January 31, 2019.\n\n* If you have a Technical Account Manager, consider contacting that person immediately to assist with your upgrade plans. Otherwise, contact Red Hat support for assistance at https://www.redhat.com/en/services/support\n\n* Alternatively, Red Hat Consulting can be engaged to assist with a smooth upgrade, or migration to Satellite 6, see https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/consulting-offering-transition-to-satellite-6-datasheet\n\nDetails of the Red Hat Satellite life cycle can be found at https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/satellite/\n    ",
