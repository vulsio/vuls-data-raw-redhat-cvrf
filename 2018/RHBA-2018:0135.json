				"text": "\nThe Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a centralized management platform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual machines. The Manager provides a comprehensive range of features including search capabilities, resource management, live migrations, and virtual infrastructure provisioning.\n\nThe Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API).\n\nChanges to the ovirt-engine component:\n\n* When live or cold merge fails, snapshot disks may be left in an illegal state. If virtual machines with illegal snapshot disks are shut down, they will not re-start. Virtual machines with illegal snapshot disks are now marked with an exclamation mark and a warning message not to shut them down. (BZ#1533061)\n\n* The kernel no longer supports the /sys/block/dm-X/queue/discard_zeroes_data file in sysfs. It is therefore no longer possible to determine whether discarded blocks from a block device returns zeros or the actual data. Therefore, the virtual machine disk properties \"Wipe After Delete\" and \"Enable Discard\" are no longer supported at the same time. (BZ#1529305)\n    ",
