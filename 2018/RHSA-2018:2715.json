Its main function is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* openstack-neutron: A router interface out of subnet IP range results in a denial of service (CVE-2018-14635)\n\nFor more details about the security issue, including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* A new configuration option bridge_mac_table_size has been added for the neutron OVS agent. This value is set on every Open vSwitch bridge managed by the openvswitch-neutron-agent. The value controls the maximum number of MAC addresses that can be learned on a bridge. The default value for this new option is 50,000, which should be enough for most systems. Values outside a reasonable range (10 to 1,000,000) might be overridden by Open vSwitch. (BZ#1589031)\n\n* Previously, when a VM was destroyed, the IPv6 lease was not removed from dnsmasq lease files due to a missing dhcp_release6 binary.\n\nWith this update, the dhcp_release6 binary is now provided in an updated dnsmasq-utils package version. (BZ#1545006)\n    ",
