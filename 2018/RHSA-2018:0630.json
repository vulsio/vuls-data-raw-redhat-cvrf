(CVE-2018-8088)\n\nThe Simple Logging Facade for Java or (SLF4J) is a simple facade for various logging APIs allowing the end-user to plug in the desired implementation at deployment time. SLF4J also allows for a gradual migration path away from Jakarta Commons Logging (JCL).\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Chris McCown for reporting CVE-2018-8088.\n    ",
