Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a newer upstream version: ansible (2.4.5)\n\nSecurity fix(es):\n\n* ansible: Ansible through version 2.5 does not properly honour the no_log option with failed task iterations. When a list of secret items is supplied to a task and a task iteration fails, secrets can be disclosed in logs despite the no_log option being enabled. (CVE-2018-10855)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Tobias Henkel (BMW Car IT GmbH) for reporting these issues.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Fixed win_copy to preserve the global Ansible local tmp path instead of\n  deleting it when dealing with multiple files\n  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/37964)\n\n* Fixed Windows setup.ps1 for slow performance in large domain environments\n  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38646)\n\n* Fixed eos_logging idempotency issue when trying to set both logging \n  destination & facility\n  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40604)\n\n* Fixed ios_logging idempotency issue when trying to set both logging \n  destination & facility\n  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41076)\n\nSee https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/v2.4.5.0-1/CHANGELOG.md for details on this release.\n    ",
