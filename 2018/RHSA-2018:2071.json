				"text": "\nThe Red Hat Virtualization Manager is a centralized management platform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual machines. The Manager provides a comprehensive range of features including search capabilities, resource management, live migrations, and virtual infrastructure provisioning.\n\nThe Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API).\n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later version: \n\n* org.ovirt.engine-root (4.2.4.5). (BZ#1576752)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* ovirt-engine: Unfiltered password when choosing manual db provisioning (CVE-2018-1075)\n\n* ovirt-engine-setup: unfiltered db password in engine-backup log (CVE-2018-1072)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nThese issues were discovered by Yedidyah Bar David (Red Hat).\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* This update enables engine-setup to upgrade PostgreSQL 9.2 to 9.5, even when the locale of the 9.2 database is different from the system locale. (BZ#1579268)\n\n* This update fixes an inefficient query that is generated when users click on the 'Users' tab in the Administration Portal. The fix ensures that the tab loads quicker. (BZ#1583619)\n\nEnhancement(s):\n\n* The storage domain's General sub-tab in the Administration Portal now shows the number of images on the storage domain under the rubric \"Images\", this corresponds to the number of LVs on a block domain. (BZ#1587885)\n    ",
