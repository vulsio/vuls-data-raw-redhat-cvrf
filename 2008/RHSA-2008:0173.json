				"text": "\nRed Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server.\n\nIt was discovered that Red Hat Directory Server 7.1, when running on Red\nHat Enterprise Linux, used insecure permissions on certain directories.\nLocal users could replace Java(TM) Archive (JAR) files and run arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running Red Hat Directory Server, or\nits applications. (CVE-2008-0890)\n\nAs well, this updated package fixes the followings bugs:\n\n* when LDAP operations such as \"ldapsearch\" were issued while the server\nwas creating a browsing index for the suffix, Red Hat Directory Server\nhanged.\n\n* when a bind operation returned LDAP controls, such as in pass-through\nauthentication, Red Hat Directory Server crashed.\n\n* if multiple-simultaneous LDAP operations were issued on entries, which\nwere indexed in a VLV index, Red Hat Directory Server hanged.\n\n* minor memory leaks, including memory leaks in replication, SASL, and\nindexing, have been resolved.\n\n* the Red Hat Directory Server crashed during start up if a log rotation\nfile, such as \"access.rotationinfo\", had a size value of 0 bytes.\n\n* on 64-bit platforms, LDAP search operations would intermittently time\nout, causing them to fail.\n\n* it was not possible to send data larger than 512 bytes through SASL\nGSSAPI. Connections failed with a message decoding error.\n\n* when the password lockout option was set, previous log in failures were\nnot cleared from the passwordCount attribute, even after a successful log\nin.\n\n* when an entry had a NULL attribute value for an attribute in a VLV index,\nediting the entry caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.\n\n* repeatedly removing and adding the same replica and replication\nagreement, caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.\n\n* random operation failures occurred when multiple-simultaneous SASL\noperations were initiated.\n\n* while VLV indexes were being created, Red Hat Directory Server ignored\nstop operations. Stop operations sent during index creation hanged.\n\n* adding an invalid DN syntax caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash,\ninstead of rejecting the entry.\n\n* modify operations that included an invalid attribute value, caused Red\nHat Directory server to crash.\n\n* malformed member URLs for dynamic groups, such as ones missing the\nterminal parentheses, caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.\n\n* in the previous redhat-ds package, SASL mappings were hard coded. In\nthis updated package, SASL mappings use regular expressions, that are\ndynamically generated on start up. A \"*\" character can no longer be used\nfor the SASL mapping search filter.\n\n* repeatedly creating and deleting databases with VLV indexes, caused Red\nHat Directory Server to crash.\n\n* editing an entry with an attribute with non-ASCII values, and indexed\nwith a substring index, caused Red Hat Directory Server to crash.\n\n* in the previous redhat-ds package, SASL operations did not properly\nswitch the SASL I/O function set to the original I/O function set.\n\n* during online replication initialization, if the data included any entry\nlarger than 80% of the entry cache size, Red Hat Directory Server crashed.\n\n* online-replication initialization hanged endlessly when the import data\nincluded two consecutive entries, which totaled more than 80% of the entry\ncache size.\n\nFor further information, please refer to the Red Hat Directory Server 7.1\nSP4 release notes:\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server/release-notes/7.1SP4/\n\nUsers of redhat-ds are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues.\n    ",

To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis starts an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on the system.\n    ",
