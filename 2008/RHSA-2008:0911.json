				"text": "\nUpdated condor packages that address multiple security issues, fix several\nbugs, and introduce feature enhancements are now available for Red Hat\nEnterprise MRG 1.0 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n    ",

				"text": "\nCondor is a specialized workload management system for compute-intensive\njobs. It provides a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority\nscheme, and resource monitoring and management.\n\nA flaw was found in the way Condor processed user submitted jobs. It was\npossible for a user to submit a job in a way that could cause that job to\nrun as a different user with access to the pool. (CVE-2008-3826)\n\nA stack based buffer overflow flaw was found in Condor's condor_schedd\ndaemon. A user who had permissions to submit a job could do so in a manner\nthat could cause condor_schedd to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the permissions of condor_schedd. (CVE-2008-3828)\n\nA denial-of-service flaw was found in Condor's condor_schedd daemon. A user\nwho had permissions to submit a job could do so in a manner that would\ncause condor_schedd to crash. (CVE-2008-3829)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Condor processes allowed and denied netmasks\nfor access control. If a configuration file contained an overlapping\nnetmask in the allow or deny rules, it could cause that rule to be ignored,\nallowing unintended access. (CVE-2008-3830)\n\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* the \"amazon_gahp -m\" command sets the AMAZON_GAHP_WORKER_MAX_NUM\nconfiguration option, fixing the maximum number of processes contacting EC2\nat any given time. Previously, Condor did not honor this option, leaving\nthe maximum number of created threads unbounded. This has been corrected:\nvalues set with the \"-m\" argument are now properly understood.\n\n* the gridmanager constructed KeyPairs for all outstanding EC2 jobs before\nany jobs are started. When there were many (>10,000) EC2 jobs in the queue,\nsignificant delays occurred. With this update, KeyPairs are no longer \nconstructed up-front.\n\n* an error in condor_negotiator caused intialization code to re-run\nwhenever condor_reconfig was run. The flag which noted if the\ninitialization code should run was always set to \"true\". This error has\nbeen corrected: the initialization code now executes only at startup.\n\n\nAs well, this update adds the following enhancements:\n\n* this release introduces Concurrency Limits. These allow Condor to account\nfor resources not directly under its control, such as software licenses.\n\n* this update includes the latest stable upstream release of Condor:\nversion 7.0.5. Information on the features and fixes included with this\nrelease are in the Condor Release Notes, available via the link in the\nReferences section below.\n\n* base support for low-latency scheduling and transparent translation of\nEC2 jobs has also been added in this update. Note: implementation of these\ntwo features depends on separate packages which are yet to be released.\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.0 users are advised to upgrade to these\nupdated packages which address these vulnerabilities, fix these bugs and\nadd these enhancements.\n    ",
