JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT\nto leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future\n(EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business\nprocess execution speed and quality.\n\nMultiple flaws were found in the way Spring Framework 3 deserialized\ncertain Java objects. If an attacker were able to control the stream from\nwhich an application with the Spring Framework 3 AOP in its class-path was\ndeserializing objects, they could use these flaws to execute arbitrary code\nwith the privileges of the JBoss Application Server process via a\nspecially-crafted, serialized Java object. (CVE-2011-2894)\n\nNote: JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform does not expose applications that\ndeserialize objects from an untrusted source by default. These flaws would\naffect applications configured to trust a malicious source, for example,\nif the messaging service was configured to look up a remote messaging\nqueue, and an attacker had control of that queue.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 5.1.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to install this update. Refer to the\nSolution section for information about installing the update.\n    ",
