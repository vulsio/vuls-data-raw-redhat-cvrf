JBoss Enterprise Application\nPlatform integrates the JBoss Application Server with JBoss Hibernate and\nJBoss Seam into a complete and simple enterprise solution.\n\nThis release of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.1 serves as a\nreplacement to JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.0. It includes\nvarious bug fixes which are detailed in the Release Notes. The Release\nNotes will be available shortly from the link in the References section.\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the fix for CVE-2011-1484 was incomplete: JBoss Seam 2\ndid not block access to all malicious JBoss Expression Language (EL)\nconstructs in page exception handling, allowing arbitrary Java methods to\nbe executed. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary\ncode via a specially-crafted URL provided to certain applications based on\nthe JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly configured and enabled Java\nSecurity Manager would prevent exploitation of this flaw. (CVE-2011-2196)\n\nIf you have created custom applications that are packaged with a copy of\nthe JBoss Seam 2 library, those applications must be rebuilt with the\nupdated jboss-seam.jar file provided by this update.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the ObjectWorks+ Development Team at Nomura\nResearch Institute for reporting this issue.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, please back up your JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform's \"jboss-as/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/\" directory, along\nwith all other customized configuration files.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.0 as provided from\nthe Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform 5.1.1.\n    ",
