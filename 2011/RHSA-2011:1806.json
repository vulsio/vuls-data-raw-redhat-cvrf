JBoss Enterprise Web\nPlatform is a subset of JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. Users are\ndirected to the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 5.1.2 Release Notes\nfor information on the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes\nwill be available shortly from\nhttps://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the Attribute Exchange (AX) extension of OpenID4Java was\nnot checking to ensure attributes were signed. If AX was being used to\nreceive information that an application only trusts the identity provider\nto assert, a remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct\nman-in-the-middle attacks and compromise the integrity of the information\nvia a specially-crafted request. By default, only the JBoss Seam openid\nexample application uses OpenID4Java. (CVE-2011-4314)\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up the\n\"jboss-as-web/server/[PROFILE]/deploy/\" directory and any other customized\nconfiguration files of your JBoss Enterprise Web Platform.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.1.1 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise Web Platform\n5.1.2.\n    ",
