				"text": "\nThese packages contain the Linux kernel.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* A flaw in the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation\ncould allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service by sending a\nspecially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system. (CVE-2011-2482,\nImportant)\n\nIf you do not run applications that use SCTP, you can prevent the sctp\nmodule from being loaded by adding the following to the end of the\n\"/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\" file:\n\nblacklist sctp\n\nThis way, the sctp module cannot be loaded accidentally, which may occur\nif an application that requires SCTP is started. A reboot is not necessary\nfor this change to take effect.\n\n* A flaw in the client-side NFS Lock Manager (NLM) implementation could\nallow a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service.\n(CVE-2011-2491, Important)\n\n* Flaws in the netlink-based wireless configuration interface could allow\na local user, who has the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, to cause a denial of\nservice or escalate their privileges on systems that have an active\nwireless interface. (CVE-2011-2517, Important)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Xen hypervisor\nimplementation emulated the SAHF instruction. When using a\nfully-virtualized guest on a host that does not use hardware assisted\npaging (HAP), such as those running CPUs that do not have support for (or\nthose that have it disabled) Intel Extended Page Tables (EPT) or AMD\nVirtualization (AMD-V) Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI), a privileged\nguest user could trigger this flaw to cause the hypervisor to crash.\n(CVE-2011-2519, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw in the __addr_ok() macro in the Linux kernel's Xen hypervisor\nimplementation when running on 64-bit systems could allow a privileged\nguest user to crash the hypervisor. (CVE-2011-2901, Moderate)\n\n* /proc/[PID]/io is world-readable by default. Previously, these files\ncould be read without any further restrictions. A local, unprivileged user\ncould read these files, belonging to other, possibly privileged processes\nto gather confidential information, such as the length of a password used\nin a process. (CVE-2011-2495, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Vasily Averin for reporting CVE-2011-2491, and\nVasiliy Kulikov of Openwall for reporting CVE-2011-2495.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* On Broadcom PCI cards that use the tg3 driver, the operational state of a\nnetwork device, represented by the value in\n\"/sys/class/net/ethX/operstate\", was not initialized by default.\nConsequently, the state was reported as \"unknown\" when the tg3 network\ndevice was actually in the \"up\" state. This update modifies the tg3 driver\nto properly set the operstate value. (BZ#744699)\n\n* A KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) guest can get preempted by the host,\nwhen a higher priority process needs to run. When a guest is not running\nfor several timer interrupts in a row, ticks could be lost, resulting in\nthe jiffies timer advancing slower than expected and timeouts taking longer\nthan expected. To correct for the issue of lost ticks,\ndo_timer_tsc_timekeeping() checks a reference clock source (kvm-clock when\nrunning as a KVM guest) to see if timer interrupts have been missed. If so,\njiffies is incremented by the number of missed timer interrupts, ensuring\nthat programs are woken up on time. (BZ#747874)\n\n* When a block device object was allocated, the bd_super field was not\nbeing explicitly initialized to NULL. Previously, users of the block device\nobject could set bd_super to NULL when the object was released by calling\nthe kill_block_super() function. Certain third-party file systems do not\nalways use this function, and bd_super could therefore become uninitialized\nwhen the object was allocated again. This could cause a kernel panic in the\nblkdev_releasepage() function, when the uninitialized bd_super field was\ndereferenced. Now, bd_super is properly initialized in the bdget()\nfunction, and the kernel panic no longer occurs. (BZ#751137)\n    ",
