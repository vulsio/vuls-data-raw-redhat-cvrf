				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* The way IPv4 and IPv6 protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs were\ngenerated could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject packets and\npossibly hijack connections. Protocol sequence numbers and fragment IDs are\nnow more random. (CVE-2011-3188, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's clock implementation on 32-bit,\nSMP (symmetric multiprocessing) systems. A local, unprivileged user could\nuse this flaw to cause a divide error fault, resulting in a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2011-3209, Moderate)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Dan Kaminsky for reporting CVE-2011-3188, and\nYasuaki Ishimatsu for reporting CVE-2011-3209.\n\nIn addition, this update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When the Global File System 2 (GFS2) file system is suspended, its delete\nwork queue is also suspended, along with any pending work on the queue.\nPrior to this update, if GFS2's transaction lock was demoted while the\ndelete work queue was suspended, a deadlock could occur on the file system\nbecause the file system tried to flush the work queue in the lock demotion\ncode. With this update, the delete work queue is no longer flushed by the\nlock demotion code, and a deadlock no longer occurs. Instead, the work\nqueue is flushed by the unmount operation, so that pending work is properly\ncompleted. (BZ#733678)\n\n* A previously applied patch introduced a regression for third-party file\nsystems that do not set the FS_HAS_IODONE2 flag, specifically, Oracle\nCluster File System 2 (OCFS2). The patch removed a call to the aio_complete\nfunction, resulting in no completion events being processed, causing\nuser-space applications to become unresponsive. This update reintroduces\nthe aio_complete function call, fixing this issue. (BZ#734156)\n\n* Certain devices support multiple operation modes. For example, EMC\nCLARiiON disk arrays support ALUA mode and their own vendor specific mode\nfor failover. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5, a bug was discovered that\nprevented tools such as multipath from being able to select the\ndevice/hardware handler plug-in to use. This resulted in the application\n(for example, multipath) not working properly. With this update, the kernel\nhas been modified to allow applications to select the device/hardware\nhandler to use, thus resolving this issue. (BZ#739900)\n\n* This update improves the performance of delete/unlink operations in a\nGFS2 file system with large files by adding a layer of metadata read-ahead\nfor indirect blocks. (BZ#743805)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to resolve these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
