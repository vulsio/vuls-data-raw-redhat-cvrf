				"text": "\nThe JBoss Communications Platform (JBCP) is an open source VoIP platform\ncertified for JAIN SLEE 1.1 and SIP Servlets 1.1 compliance. JBCP serves as\na high performance core for Service Delivery Platforms (SDPs) and IP\nMultimedia Subsystems (IMSs) by leveraging J2EE to enable the convergence\nof data and video in Next-Generation Intelligent Network (NGIN)\napplications.\n\nThis release of JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.1 serves as a replacement\nto JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.0. It includes various bug fixes which\nare detailed in the Release Notes. The Release Notes will be available\nshortly from the link in the References section.\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that JBoss Seam 2 did not properly block access to JBoss\nExpression Language (EL) constructs in page exception handling, allowing\narbitrary Java methods to be executed. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to execute arbitrary code via a specially-crafted URL provided to\ncertain applications based on the JBoss Seam 2 framework. Note: A properly\nconfigured and enabled Java Security Manager would prevent exploitation of\nthis flaw. (CVE-2011-1484)\n\nIf you have created custom applications that are packaged with a copy of\nthe JBoss Seam 2 library, those applications must be rebuilt with the\nupdated jboss-seam.jar file provided by this update.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Martin Kouba from IT SYSTEMS a.s. for reporting\nthis issue.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on\nJBoss Communications Platform, along with all customized configuration\nfiles.\n\nAll users of JBoss Communications Platform 5.1.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Communications\nPlatform 5.1.1.\n    ",
