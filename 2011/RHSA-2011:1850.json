				"text": "\nThe rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nUsing the SG_IO IOCTL to issue SCSI requests to partitions or LVM volumes\nresulted in the requests being passed to the underlying block device. If a\nprivileged user only had access to a single partition or LVM volume, they\ncould use this flaw to bypass those restrictions and gain read and write\naccess (and be able to issue other SCSI commands) to the entire block\ndevice.\n\nIn KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) environments using raw format virtio\ndisks backed by a partition or LVM volume, a privileged guest user could\nbypass intended restrictions and issue read and write requests (and other\nSCSI commands) on the host, and possibly access the data of other guests\nthat reside on the same underlying block device. Refer to Red Hat Bugzilla\nbug 752375 for further details and a mitigation script for users who cannot\napply this update immediately. (CVE-2011-4127)\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nvarious security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes\nincluded in this update address the following CVE numbers:\n\nCVE-2011-4539 (dhcp issue)\n\nCVE-2011-4339 (ipmitool issue)\n\nCVE-2011-1530 (krb5 issue)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Virtual LAN (VLAN) identifiers containing a space were accepted, even\nthough they could not be configured correctly. With this update, VLAN\nidentifiers containing a space are rejected with an \"Invalid VLAN ID\"\nmessage. (BZ#761537)\n\n* After configuring netconsole, it was not possible to start the service:\nthe \"service netconsole start\" command failed with a warning that\nconfigfs.ko could not be found, and a fatal error that netconsole.ko could\nnot be inserted. With this update, the netconsole service starts as\nexpected. Note that after netconsole is configured, the service will not\nautomatically start, even after rebooting. The service must be manually\nstarted. (BZ#765898)\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which corrects these issues.\n    ",
