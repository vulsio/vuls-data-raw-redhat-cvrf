A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,\nwhich gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in\nthe References section.\n    ",

				"text": "\nThe resource-agents package contains a set of scripts to interface with\nseveral services to operate in a High Availability environment for both\nPacemaker and rgmanager service managers.\n\nIt was discovered that certain resource agent scripts set the\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to an insecure value containing empty\npath elements. A local user able to trick a user running those scripts to\nrun them while working from an attacker-writable directory could use this\nflaw to escalate their privileges via a specially-crafted dynamic library.\n(CVE-2010-3389)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Raphael Geissert for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* When using the Sybase database and the ASEHAagent resource in the\ncluster.conf file, it was not possible to run more than one ASEHAagent per\nSybase installation. Consequently, a second ASEHA (Sybase Adaptive Server\nEnterprise (ASE) with the High Availability Option) agent could not be run.\nThis bug has been fixed and it is now possible to use two ASEHA agents\nusing the same Sybase installation. (BZ#711852)\n\n* The s/lang scripts, which implement internal functionality for the\nrgmanager package, while the central_processing option is in use, were\nincluded in the wrong package. Now, the rgmanager and resource-agents\npackages require each other for installation to prevent problems when they\nare used separately. (BZ#693518)\n\n* Previously, the oracledb.sh script was using the \"shutdown abort\" command\nas the first attempt to shut down a database. With this update, oracledb.sh\nfirst attempts a graceful shutdown via the \"shutdown immediate\" command\nbefore forcing the shutdown. (BZ#689801)\n\n* Previously, when setting up a service on a cluster with a shared IP\nresource and an Apache resource, the generated httpd.conf file contained a\nbug in the line describing the shared IP address (the \"Listen\" line). Now,\nthe Apache resource agent generates the \"Listen\" line properly. (BZ#667217)\n\n* If a high-availability (HA) cluster service was defined with an Apache\nresource and was named with two words, such as \"kickstart httpd\", the\nservice never started because it could not find a directory with the space\ncharacter in its name escaped. Now, Apache resources work properly if a\nname contains a space as described above. (BZ#667222)\n\n* When inheritance was used in the cluster.conf file, a bug in the\n/usr/share/cluster/nfsclient.sh file prevented it from monitoring NFS\nexports properly. Consequently, monitoring of NFS exports to NFS clients\nresulted in an endless loop. This bug has been fixed and the monitoring now\nworks as expected. (BZ#691814)\n\n* Previously, the postgres-8 resource agent did not detect when a\nPostgreSQL server failed to start. This bug has been fixed and postgres-8\nnow works as expected in the described scenario. (BZ#694816)\n\n* When using the Pacemaker resource manager, the fs.sh resource agent\nreported an error condition, if called with the \"monitor\" parameter and the\nreferenced device did not exist. Consequently, the error condition\nprevented the resource from being started. Now, fs.sh returns the proper\nresponse code in the described scenario, thus fixing this bug. (BZ#709400)\n\n* Previously, numerous RGManager resource agents returned incorrect\nresponse codes when coupled with the Pacemaker resource manager. Now, the\nagents have been updated to work with Pacemaker properly. (BZ#727643)\n\nThis update also adds the following enhancement:\n\n* With this update, when the network is removed from a node using the\nnetfs.sh resource agent, it now recovers faster than previously.\n(BZ#678497)\n\nAs well, this update upgrades the resource-agents package to upstream\nversion 3.9.2, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over\nthe previous version. (BZ#707127)\n\nAll users of resource-agents are advised to upgrade to this updated\npackage, which corrects these issues and adds these enhancements.\n    ",
