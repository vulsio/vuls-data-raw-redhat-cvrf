The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor.\nIt includes everything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A\nsubset of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red\nHat Enterprise Virtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA flaw was found that allowed napi_reuse_skb() to be called on VLAN\n(virtual LAN) packets. An attacker on the local network could trigger this\nflaw by sending specially-crafted packets to a target system, possibly\ncausing a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1576)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ryan Sweat for reporting CVE-2011-1576.\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nsecurity issues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor. These fixes are for bash issue\nCVE-2008-5374; curl issue CVE-2011-2192; kernel issues CVE-2010-4649,\nCVE-2011-0695, CVE-2011-0711, CVE-2011-1044, CVE-2011-1182, CVE-2011-1573,\nCVE-2011-1593, CVE-2011-1745, CVE-2011-1746, CVE-2011-1776, CVE-2011-1780,\nCVE-2011-1936, CVE-2011-2022, CVE-2011-2213, CVE-2011-2492, CVE-2011-2525,\nand CVE-2011-2689; libvirt issue CVE-2011-2511; and rsync issue\nCVE-2007-6200.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will\nbe available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the\nReferences section.\n\nAs Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is based on KVM, the bug\nfixes from the KVM update RHBA-2011:1068 have been included in this update:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2011-1068.html\n\nUsers of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which resolves this issue and fixes the\nbugs noted in the Technical Notes.\n    ",
