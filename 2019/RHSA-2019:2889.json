Red Hat Virtualization Hosts (RHVH) are installed using a special build of Red Hat Enterprise Linux with only the packages required to host virtual machines. RHVH features a Cockpit user interface for monitoring the host's resources and performing administrative tasks. \n\nThe following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: redhat-release-virtualization-host (4.3.5), redhat-virtualization-host (4.3.5). (BZ#1751436, BZ#1754063)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs, logged the buffer descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the host. (CVE-2019-14835)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n    ",
