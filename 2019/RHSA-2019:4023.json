(BZ#1724260)\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* samba: Combination of parameters and permissions can allow the user to escape from the share path definition (CVE-2019-10197)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* The samba packages have been upgraded to upstream version 4.9.8 which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous version. (BZ#1724260)\n\n* Previously, CTDB was unable to start due to a missing filesystem directory. In spite of manually creating the directory, CTDB could not function properly due to an incorrect SELinux context. With this update, the rpm package now properly creates the missing directory with the required SELinux context and CTDB starts correctly. (BZ#1772836)\n\nUsers of Samba with Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.\n    ",
