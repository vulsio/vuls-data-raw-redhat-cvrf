Ansible works over SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred to managed machines automatically.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* ansible: Failed tasks do not honour no_log option allowing for secrets to be disclosed in logs (CVE-2018-10855)\n\n* ansible: Inventory variables are loaded from current working directory when running ad-hoc command that can lead to code execution (CVE-2018-10874)\n\n* ansible: ansible.cfg is being read from current working directory allowing possible code execution (CVE-2018-10875)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Tobias Henkel (BMW Car IT GmbH) for reporting CVE-2018-10855 and Michael Scherer (OSAS) for reporting CVE-2018-10874.
