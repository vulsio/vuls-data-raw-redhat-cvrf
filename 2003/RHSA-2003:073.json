				"text": "\nSendmail is a widely used Mail Transport Agent (MTA) which is included\nin all Red Hat Linux distributions.\n\nDuring a code audit of Sendmail by ISS, a critical vulnerability was\nuncovered that affects unpatched versions of Sendmail prior to version\n8.12.8.  A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted email message\nwhich, when processed by sendmail, causes arbitrary code to be\nexecuted as root.\n\nWe are advised that a proof-of-concept exploit is known to exist, but\nis not believed to be in the wild.\n\nSince this is a message-based vulnerability, MTAs other than Sendmail\nmay pass on the carefully crafted message.  This means that unpatched\nversions of Sendmail inside a network could still be at risk even if\nthey do not accept external connections directly.\n\nIn addition, the restricted shell (SMRSH) in Sendmail  allows attackers to\nbypass the intended restrictions of smrsh by inserting additional commands\nafter \"||\" sequences or \"/\" characters, which are not properly filtered or\nverified.  A sucessful attack would allow an attacker who has a local\naccount on a system which has explicitly enabled smrsh to execute arbitrary\nbinaries as themselves by utilizing their .forward file. \n\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages.  For Red Hat\nLinux 8.0 we have included Sendmail version 8.12.8 which is not vulnerable\nto these issues.  For all other distributions we have included a backported\npatch which corrects these vulnerabilities.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Eric Allman for his assistance with this\nvulnerability.\n    ",
