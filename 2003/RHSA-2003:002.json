This could allow remote\nattackers to execute arbitrary commands via carefully crafted URLs,\nfilenames, or email addresses.  CAN-2002-1393.\n\nKDE versions up to and including KDE 3.1.1 have a vulnerability caused by\n-dSAFER not being used when previewing in Konquerer.  An attacker can\nprepare a malicious PostScript or PDF file which provides the attacker\nwith access to the victim's account and privileges  when the victim opens\nthis malicious file for viewing or when the victim browses a directory\ncontaining such malicious file and has file previews enabled.\n\nRed Hat Linux 9 provides KDE version 3.1 and is not vulnerable to the first\nissue (CAN-2002-1393).  This erratum provides updated packages with a\nbackported fix for the malicious PostScript and PDF issue.\n\nRed Hat Linux 7.3 and 8.0 currently provide KDE version 3.0.3 and are\nvulnerable to both of these issues. This erratum provides KDE 3.0.5a\npackages with patches to correct these issues.\n\nRed Hat Linux 7.2 shipped with KDE 2.2.2, and Red Hat Linux 7.1 shipped\nwith KDE 2.1.1. The versions are vulnerable to both of the issues. This\nerratum provides packages which contain backported patches to correct the\nissues.\n    ",
