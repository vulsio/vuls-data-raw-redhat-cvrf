				"text": "\nVTE is an terminal emulator widget used by software such as gnome-terminal.\n\nOne feature that most terminal emulators support is the ability\nfor the shell to set the title of the window using an escape sequence. \nCertain xterm variants also provide an escape sequence for reporting the\ncurrent window title.  This essentially takes the current title and places\nit directly on the command line.  This feature could be potentially\nexploited if an attacker can cause carefully crafted escape sequences to be\ndisplayed on a vulnerable terminal emulator used by their victim.\n\nSince it is not possible to embed a carriage return into the window title\nitself, the attacker would have to convince the victim to hit enter for it\nto process the title as a command, although the attacker can perform a\nnumber of actions to increase the likelyhood of this happening.\n\nVTE is vulnerable to this issue and is used as the default terminal\nemulator for versions of gnome-terminal shipped with Red Hat Linux 8.0. \nPrevious releases of Red Hat Linux do not contain a vulnerable version of\ngnome-terminal.\n\nUsers of gnome-terminal on Red Hat Linux 8.0 are advised to upgrade to\nthese errata packages, which contain a patch to disable the title reporting\nfunctionality.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank H D Moore for bringing these issues to our\nattention.\n\nPlease note; because this update contains a fixed shared library used by\ngnome-terminal, the vulnerable code will continue to be in use as long as\nany gnome-terminal session remains active. The easiest way to ensure that\nthe vulnerable code is no longer in use is to log out of your window\nmanager. Alternatively all running gnome-terminal sessions can be closed.\n    ",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
