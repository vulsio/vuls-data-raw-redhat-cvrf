The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0686 to this issue.\n\nRed Hat Linux versions 7.2, 7.3, 8.0, and 9 ship with versions of pam_smb\nthat are vulnerable to this issue, however pam_smb is not enabled by default.\n\nUsers of pam_smb are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a patch to version 1.1.6 to correct this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Dave Airlie of the Samba team for notifying us\nof this issue.\n    ",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
