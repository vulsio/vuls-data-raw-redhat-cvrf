LPRng includes a program, psbanner, that can be\nused to produce Postscript banner pages to separate print jobs.  \n\nA vulnerability has been found in psbanner, which creates in an insecure\nmanner a temporary file with a known filename.  An attacker could create a\nsymbolic link and cause arbitrary files to be written as the lp user.\n\nNote: psbanner is not used by the default Red Hat Enterprise Linux LPRng\nconfiguration.\n\nUsers that have configured LPRng to use psbanner should install these\nupdated packages, which contain a patch so that psbanner does not create\nthe temporary file.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
