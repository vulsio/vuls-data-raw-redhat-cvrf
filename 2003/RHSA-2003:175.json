This would prevent an expected warning message from being generated.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which include\npatches from the GnuPG development team that correct this issue for GnuPG\nversions 1.0.7 and 1.2.1. This update also upgrades Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2,\nand 7.3 users to GnuPG version 1.0.7.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
