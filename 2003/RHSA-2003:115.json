The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1158 to this issue.\n\nAdditionally, it was discovered that request validation was lacking in\nCanna server versions 3.6 and earlier. A malicious remote user could\nexploit this vulnerability to leak information or cause a denial of service\nattack.(CAN-2002-1159)\n\nRed Hat Linux ships with a Canna package vulnerable to these issues;\nhowever, the package is normally only installed when Japanese language\nsupport is selected during installation.\n\nAll users of Canna are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain a backported security fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank hsj and AIDA Shinra for the responsible\ndisclosure of these issues.\n    ",
