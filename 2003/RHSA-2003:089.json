				"text": "\nThe glibc package contains standard libraries that are used by\nmultiple programs on the system.  Sun RPC is a remote procedure call\nframework that allows clients to invoke procedures in a server process\nover a network.  XDR is a mechanism for encoding data structures for use\nwith RPC.  Glibc contains an XDR encoder/decoder derived from Sun's RPC\nimplementation, which was demonstrated to be vulnerable to an integer\noverflow.\n\nAn integer overflow is present in the xdrmem_getbytes() function of glibc\n2.3.1 and earlier.  Depending upon the application, this vulnerability\ncould cause buffer overflows and may be exploitable leading to arbitrary\ncode execution.\n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages which contain patches to\nthe glibc libraries and therefore are not vulnerable to these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank eEye Digital Security for alerting us to this\nissue.\n\nThe Red Hat Linux 8.0 errata packages also contain a number of bug fixes\nthat are not security related. For details, see the list of bugzilla bugs\nfixed by this errata or the ChangeLog.\n\n[Updated 9 April 2003]\nSome bugs newly introduced by the Red Hat Linux 8.0 errata packages\nhas been discovered, such as wine problems or problems with debugging\nthreaded applications.\n\nOnce the glibc upgrade has been completed, you must either reboot the\nsystem or restart all programs on the system (for example, by using telinit\n1 and switching back to the old runlevel). Rebooting the system or\nrestarting the system programs is necessary to avoid vulnerable glibc\ncopies in memory and because changes in NSS internal interfaces which mean\nthat one cannot mix old NSS modules or libresolv in an application with\nupgraded NSS modules or libresolv in one running application.\n\nIf sshd is running so that the other services can be restarted remotely or\nfor a remote reboot during an unattended glibc upgrade, glibc will also\nrestart sshd.\n    ",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
