This program contains several\nvulnerabilities.\n\nNOTE: Although the SANE packages include this program, it is not used by\ndefault under Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n\nThe IP address of the remote host is only checked after the first\ncommunication occurs, causing saned.conf restrictions to be ineffective for\nthe first communication.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0773 to this issue.\n\nA connection that is dropped early causes one of several problems.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe names CAN-2003-0774, CAN-2003-0775, and CAN-2003-0777 to these issues.\n\nLack of error checking can cause various other unfavorable consequences. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2003-0776 and CAN-2003-0778 to these issues.\n\nUsers of SANE (particularly those that use saned for remote scanner access)\nshould upgrade to these errata packages, which contain a backported\nsecurity patch to resolve these issues.\n    ",
