A side effect of this restriction was that some applications\nwith large address space requirements might execute successfully on an \nx86-based platform, but might not run on an AMD64-based platform.\n\nThese updated kernel packages significantly raise this address space limit.\n    ",

						"text": "\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt\n    ",
