				"text": "\nGnuPG is a utility for encrypting data and creating digital signatures.\n\nPhong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses\nElGamal keys, when those keys are used both to sign and encrypt data.  This\nvulnerability can be used to trivially recover the private key.  While the\ndefault behavior of GnuPG when generating keys does not lead to the\ncreation of unsafe keys, by overriding the default settings an unsafe key\ncould have been created.\n\nIf you are using ElGamal keys, you should revoke those keys immediately.\n\nThe packages included in this update do not make ElGamal keys safe to use;\nthey merely include a patch by David Shaw that disables functions that\nwould generate or use ElGamal keys.\n\nTo determine if your key is affected, run the following command to obtain a\nlist of secret keys that you have on your secret keyring:\n\ngpg --list-secret-keys\n\nThe output of this command includes both the size and type of the keys\nfound, and will look similar to this example:\n\n/home/example/.gnupg/secring.gpg\n----------------------------------------------------\nsec  1024D/01234567 2000-10-17 Example User <example@example.com>\nuid                            Example User <example@example.com>\n\nThe key length, type, and ID are listed together, separated by a forward\nslash.  In the example output above, the key's type is \"D\" (DSA, sign\nand encrypt).  Your key is unsafe if and only if the key type is \"G\"\n(ElGamal, sign and encrypt).  In the above example, the secret key is safe\nto use, while the secret key in the following example is not:\n\n/home/example/.gnupg/secring.gpg\n----------------------------------------------------\nsec  1024G/01234567 2000-10-17 Example User <example@example.com>\nuid                            Example User <example@example.com>\n\nFor more details regarding this issue, as well as instructions on how to\nrevoke any keys that are unsafe, refer to the advisory available from the\nGnuPG web site:\n\nhttp://www.gnupg.org/\n    ",

						"text": "\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe desired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt\n    ",
