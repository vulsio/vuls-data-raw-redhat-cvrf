An active attacker may be able to use timing observations\nto distinguish between two different error cases: cipher padding errors and\nMAC verification errors.  Over multiple connections this can leak\nsufficient information to make it possible to retrieve the plaintext of a\ncommon, fixed block.\n\nIn order for an attack to be sucessful, an attacker must be able to act as\na man-in-the-middle to intercept and modify multiple connections, which all\ninvolve a common fixed plaintext block (such as a password), and have good\nnetwork conditions that allow small changes in timing to be reliably\nobserved.\n\nThese erratum packages contain a patch provided by the OpenSSL group that\ncorrects this vulnerability.\n\nBecause server applications are affected by these vulnerabilities, we\nadvise users to restart all services that use OpenSSL functionality or\nalternatively reboot their systems after installing these updates.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe desired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
