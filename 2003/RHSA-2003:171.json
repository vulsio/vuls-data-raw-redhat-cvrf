CUPS is used as the default print spooler on new\ninstallations of Red Hat Linux 9, and has been provided (though not as the\ndefault) for Red Hat Linux 7.3 and Red Hat Linux 8.0.\n\nPhil D'Amore of Red Hat discovered a vulnerability in the CUPS IPP\n(Internet Printing Protocol) implementation.  The IPP implementation is\nsingle-threaded, which means only one request can be serviced at a time. \nAn attacker could make a partial request that does not time out and\ntherefore creates a denial of service. In order to exploit this bug, an\nattacker must have the ability to make a TCP connection to the IPP port (by\ndefault 631). \n\nAll print servers using CUPS should upgrade to these erratum packages,\nwhich contain a patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
