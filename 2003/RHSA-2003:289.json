				"text": "\nXFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System providing the core\ngraphical user interface and video drivers. XDM is the X display manager.\n\nMultiple integer overflows in the transfer and enumeration of font\nlibraries in XFree86 allow local or remote attackers to cause a denial of\nservice or execute arbitrary code via heap-based and stack-based buffer\noverflow attacks.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0730 to this issue.  \n\nThe risk to users from this vulnerability is  limited because only clients\ncan be affected by these bugs, however in some (non-default)\nconfigurations, both xfs and the X Server can act as clients\nto remote font servers.\n\nXDM does not verify whether the pam_setcred function call succeeds, which\nmay allow attackers to gain root privileges by triggering error conditions\nwithin PAM modules, as demonstrated in certain configurations of the\npam_krb5 module.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0690 to this issue.  \n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated XFree86 4.1.0 packages, which\ncontain backported security patches and are not vulnerable to these issues.\n    ",
