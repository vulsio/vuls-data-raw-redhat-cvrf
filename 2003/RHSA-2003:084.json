The part numbers, which can be\nfound on the bottom flap of the box, are RHF0120US and  RHF0121US.\nCopies of Red Hat Linux 9 obtained through other means (such as from Red\nHat Network, FTP, or international boxed sets) already contain the packages\nreferenced by this erratum, and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
