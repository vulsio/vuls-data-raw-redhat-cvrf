				"text": "\nThe shadow-utils package includes programs for converting UNIX password\nfiles to the shadow password format, plus programs for managing user and\ngroup accounts.  One of these programs is useradd and is used to create or\nupdate new user information.\n\nWhen creating a user account, the version of useradd included in Red Hat\nLinux 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 creates a mailbox file with incorrectly-set\ngroup ownership.  Instead of setting the file's group ownership to the\n'mail' group, it is set to the user's primary group.\n\nOn systems where other users share the same primary group, this would allow\nthose users to be able to read and write other user mailboxes.\n\nThese erratum packages contain an updated patch to useradd.  Where a 'mail'\ngroup exists, mailboxes will be created with group 'mail' having read and\nwrite permissions.  Otherwise the mailbox file will be created without\ngroup read and write permissions.\n\nAll users of Red Hat Linux are advised to update to these erratum packages\nand to also check the /var/spool/mail directory to ensure that all mailbox\nfiles have appropriate permissions.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
