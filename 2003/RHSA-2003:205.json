				"text": "\nOpenSSL is a commercial-grade, full-featured, and open source toolkit that \nimplements Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose\ncryptography library.\n\nIn a paper, Brice Canvel, Alain Hiltgen, Serge Vaudenay, and Martin\nVuagnoux describe and demonstrate a timing-based attack on CBC ciphersuites\nin SSL and TLS. An active attacker may be able to use timing observations\nto distinguish between two different error cases: cipher padding errors and\nMAC verification errors. Over multiple connections this can leak\nsufficient information to make it possible to retrieve the plaintext of a\ncommon, fixed block.\n\nIn order for an attack to be sucessful, an attacker must be able to act as\na man-in-the-middle to intercept and modify multiple connections, which all\ninvolve a common fixed plaintext block (such as a password), and have good\nnetwork conditions that allow small changes in timing to be reliably\nobserved.\n\nResearchers discovered a timing attack on RSA keys.  Applications making\nuse of OpenSSL are generally vulnerable to such an attack, unless RSA\nblinding has been turned on.  OpenSSL does not use RSA blinding by default\nand most applications do not enable RSA blinding.  \n\nA local or remote attacker could use this attack to obtain the server's\nprivate key by determining factors using timing differences on (1) the\nnumber of extra reductions during Montgomery reduction, and (2) the use of\ndifferent integer multiplication algorithms (\"Karatsuba\" and normal).\n\nIn order for an attack to be sucessful, an attacker must have good\nnetwork conditions allowing small changes in timing to be reliably\nobserved.\n\nAdditionally, the SSL and TLS components for OpenSSL allow remote attackers\nto perform an unauthorized RSA private key operation via a modified\nBleichenbacher attack. This attack uses a large number of SSL or TLS\nconnections, using PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, and causes OpenSSL to leak\ninformation regarding the relationship between ciphertext and the\nassociated plaintext, aka the \"Klima-Pokorny-Rosa attack.\"\n\nThese erratum packages contain patches provided by the OpenSSL group that\nenable RSA blinding by default and protect against the other vulnerabilities.\n\nBecause server applications are affected by these vulnerabilities, users\nare advised to restart all services that use OpenSSL functionality, or\nreboot their systems after installing these updates.\n    ",
