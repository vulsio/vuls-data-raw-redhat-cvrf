				"text": "\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.  \n\nSecurity issues have been found that affect the versions of the Linux\nkernel shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux:\n\nCAN-2003-0462: Paul Starzetz discovered a file read race condition existing\nin the execve() system call, which could cause a local crash.\n\nCAN-2003-0501: The /proc filesystem in Linux allows local users to obtain\nsensitive information by opening various entries in /proc/self before\nexecuting a setuid program. This causes the program to fail to change the\nownership and permissions of already opened entries.\n\nCAN-2003-0550: The STP protocol is known to have no security, which could\nallow attackers to alter the bridge topology. STP is now turned off by\ndefault.\n\nCAN-2003-0551: STP input processing was lax in its length checking, which\ncould lead to a denial of service (DoS).\n\nCAN-2003-0552: Jerry Kreuscher discovered that the Forwarding table could\nbe spoofed by sending forged packets with bogus source addresses the same\nas the local host.\n\nCAN-2003-0619: An integer signedness error in the decode_fh function of\nnfs3xdr.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel\npanic) via a negative size value within XDR data of an NFSv3 procedure call.\n\nCAN-2003-0699: The C-Media PCI sound driver in Linux kernel versions prior\nto 2.4.21 accesses userspace without using the get_user function, which is\na potential security hole.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain\nbackported security patches correcting these vulnerabilities.\n    ",
