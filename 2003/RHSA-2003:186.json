This bug\naffects both Red Hat Linux 8.0 and 9.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0245 to\nthis issue.\n\nA build system problem in Apache 2.0 through 2.0.45 allows remote attackers\nto cause a denial of access to authenticated content when a threaded\nserver is used.   This bug affects only Red Hat Linux 9 when the threaded\nserver \"httpd.worker\" has been configured, which is not the default.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0189 to this issue.\n\nAll users of the Apache HTTP Web Server are advised to upgrade to the\napplicable errata packages, which contain back-ported fixes correcting\nthese issues, and applied to Apache version 2.0.40.\n\nAfter the errata packages are installed, restart the Web service by running\nthe following command:\n\n/sbin/service httpd restart\n\nRed Hat would like to thank iDefense who initially discovered CAN-2003-0245\nand John Hughes for CAN-2003-0189.\n    ",
