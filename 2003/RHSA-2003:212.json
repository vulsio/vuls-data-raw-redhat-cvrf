				"text": "\nThe glibc package contains standard libraries that are used by\nmultiple programs.\n\nAn integer overflow is present in the xdrmem_getbytes() function of glibc\n2.3.1 and earlier.  Depending upon the application, this vulnerability\ncould cause buffer overflows and may be exploitable, leading to arbitrary\ncode execution.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank eEye Digital Security for alerting us to this\nissue.\n\nAn error in the calculation of memory needed for unpacking arrays in the\nXDR decoder in glibc 2.2.5 and earlier can result in a heap buffer\noverflow. Depending upon the application, this vulnerability may be\nexploitable and lead to arbitrary code execution.\n\nA read buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the glibc resolver code in\nversions of glibc up to and including 2.2.5. The vulnerability is triggered\nby DNS packets larger than 1024 bytes and can cause applications to crash.\n\nA buffer overflow vulnerability has been found in the way the glibc\nresolver handles the resolution of network names and addresses via DNS (as\nper Internet RFC 1011). Version 2.2.5 of glibc and earlier versions are\naffected. A system would be vulnerable to this issue if the \"networks\"\ndatabase in /etc/nsswitch.conf includes the \"dns\" entry. By default, Red\nHat Linux ships with \"networks\" set to \"files\" and is therefore not\nvulnerable to this issue. (CAN-2002-0684)\n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages, which contain patches to\nthe glibc libraries and are therefore not vulnerable to these issues.\n\nNOTE: Once the glibc upgrade has been completed, you must either reboot the\nsystem or restart all programs on the system (for example, by using telinit\n1 and then switching back to the original runlevel). Rebooting the system\nor restarting the system programs is necessary to avoid vulnerable glibc\ncopies in memory.  In addition, one cannot mix old NSS modules or libresolv\nwith upgraded NSS modules or libresolve in one running application.\n\nNote also that, if sshd is running so that the other services can be\nrestarted remotely or for a remote reboot during an unattended glibc\nupgrade, glibc will also restart sshd.\n    ",
