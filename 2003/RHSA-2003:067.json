				"text": "\nNew XFree86 packages for Red Hat Linux 8.0 are now available which include\nseveral security fixes, bug fixes, enhancements, and driver updates.\n\n[Updated: June 30, 2003]\nThe XFree86 4.2.1-20 packages which were originally released in this\nadvisory were accidentally built with debugging info enabled due to a\ntemporary problem with our build system.  Unfortunately, this problem was\nnot noticed during package testing, and caused the new XFree86 packages to\ncontain full debug symbol data, resulting in extremely large packages.\n\nNote that the previously released packages are functional and should not\ncause any problems on systems with adequate disk space.  However we are\nreleasing new XFree86 4.2.1-21 packages to both minimize the download time\nfor people that have not yet updated XFree86 on their systems, and to\nminimize the disk space footprint caused by this issue.  Additionally, our\ntesting procedures have also been updated to automatically catch similar\nissues in the future.\n\nRed Hat apologizes for any inconvenience this may have caused you.\n    ",

				"text": "\nXFree86 is an implementation of the X Window System providing the core\ngraphical user interface and video drivers in Red Hat Linux. \n\nA number of security vulnerabilities have been discovered in XFree86 4.2.0:\n\n- Xterm, provided as part of the XFree86 packages, provides an escape\nsequence for reporting the current window title. This escape sequence\nessentially takes the current title and places it directly on the command\nline. An attacker can craft an escape sequence that sets the victim's Xterm\nwindow title to an arbitrary command, and then reports it to the command\nline. Since it is not possible to embed a carriage return into the window\ntitle, the attacker would then have to convince the victim to press Enter\nfor the shell to process the title as a command, although the attacker\ncould craft other escape sequences that might convince the victim to do so.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0063 to this issue.\n\n- It is possible to lock up versions of Xterm by sending an invalid DEC\nUDK escape sequence. (CAN-2003-0071)\n\n- XFree86 4.2.1 also contains an updated fix for CAN-2002-0164, a\nvulnerability in the MIT-SHM extension of the X server that allows local\nusers to read and write arbitrary shared memory. The original fix did not\ncover the case where the X server is started from xdm.\n\n- The X server was setting the /dev/dri directory permissions incorrectly,\nwhich resulted in the directory being world writable. It now sets the\ndirectory permissions to a safe value.  (CAN-2001-1409)\n\nDriver updates and additions:\n\n- Savage driver updated to Tim Roberts' latest version 1.1.27t.\n\n- Added new \"cyrix\" driver from Alan Cox, which works much better on\n  MediaGX hardware.\n\n- Added new input drivers from Alan Cox for Fujitsu Stylistic (fpit),\n  Palmax PD1000/PD1100 Input driver (palmax), Union Reality UR-98\n  head tracker (ur98)\n\n- Backported apm driver from XFree86 CVS, DPMS support enhancements, and a   \n  few accel fixes\n\n- Backported ark driver from XFree86 CVS\n\n- Backported chips driver from XFree86 CVS, with hardware mouse\n  cursor and 2D accleration fixes.\n\n- Backported cirrus i740, siliconmotion, and ark drivers from XFree86 CVS\n\nVarious bug fixes and enhancements:\n\n- Bug fixes for the RENDER extension and libraries which improve stability\n\n- Various fixes to the Xaw library\n\n- A long standing problem in the X server has been fixed in which \n  the mouse, keyboard, or video would hang, or the server to go into an \n  endless loop whenever the system time was changed backward while X was \n  running\n\n- Fixed a bug in both the Radeon and Rage 128 drivers which caused\n  crashes while using VMware with DGA when DRI is enabled\n\n- The Matrox \"mga\" driver had some problems with multihead and the RENDER\n  extension which have been worked around.\n\n- fc-cache is now run upon font package installation in all font\n  directories containing fonts managed by fontconfig/Xft\n\n- mkfontdir has been modified to force the permissions of the files it\n  generates to be mode 0644 ensuring they are world readable independant of\n  umask.\n\n- Added a new option \"ForceLegacyCRT\" to the radeon driver to allow use \n  of legacy VGA monitors which can not be detected automatically. This \n  option is only safe to use in single-head setups and may cause serious \n  problems if used with dual-head.\n\n- xterm session management is now enabled by default, whereas the stock\n  XFree86 default in 4.2.0/4.2.1 was accidentally disabled upstream\n\n- Removed and obsoleted the XFree86-xtrap-clients package, and merged it\n  into the main XFree86 package to simplify packaging\n\nThere are various other fixes included which users can review by examining\nthe RPM package changelog of any of the new XFree86 packages.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to these updated XFree86 4.2.1 packages, which\nare not vulnerable to the previously mentioned security issues.\n    ",
