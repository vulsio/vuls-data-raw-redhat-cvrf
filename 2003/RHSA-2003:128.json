An attacker could exploit this because various packages\n(Mutt, for example) make use of EOG for image viewing.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which contain a\nbackported patch correcting this issue.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
