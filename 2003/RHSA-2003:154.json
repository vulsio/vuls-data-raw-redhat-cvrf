				"text": "\nISC BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is an implementation of the DNS\n(Domain Name System) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server (named),\nwhich resolves host names to IP addresses; a resolver library\n(routines for applications to use when interfacing with DNS); and\nvarious tools.\n \nA buffer overflow vulnerability exists in multiple implementations of the\nDNS resolver libraries.  Applications that utilize vulnerable DNS resolver\nlibraries may be affected.  A remote attacker who is able to send malicious\nDNS responses could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute\narbitrary code or cause a denial of service on a vulnerable system. \n\nRed Hat Linux does not ship with any applications or libraries that link \nagainst the BIND resolver libraries; however, third party code may be affected.\n\nVersions of BIND 9 prior to 9.2.1 have a bug that causes certain requests\nto the BIND name server (named) to fail an internal consistency check,\ncausing the name server to stop responding to requests.  This can be used\nby a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DOS) attack against name\nservers.\n\nThe updated bind packages included in this errata contain Bind 9.2.1 with\nthe addition of backported patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.\n    ",
