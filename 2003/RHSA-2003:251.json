The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0468 to\nthis issue.\n\nPostfix versions from 1.1 up to and including 1.1.12 have a bug where a\nremote attacker could send a malformed envelope address and:\n\n1) cause the queue manager to lock up until an entry is removed from the\nqueue or,\n\n2) lock up the SMTP listener, leading to a DoS.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0540 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Postfix are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a version of Postfix 1.1.12 with the addition of a security patch\nand is not vulnerable to either of these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Michal Zalewski for discovering and disclosing\nthe flaws and to Wietse Venema for providing patches.\n    ",
