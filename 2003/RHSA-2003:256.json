				"text": "\nPerl is a high-level programming language commonly used for system\nadministration utilities and Web programming.\n\nTwo security issues have been found in Perl that affect the Perl packages\nshipped with Red Hat Linux:\n\nWhen safe.pm versions 2.0.7 and earlier are used with Perl 5.8.0 and\nearlier, it is possible for an attacker to break out of safe compartments\nwithin Safe::reval and Safe::rdo by using a redefined @_ variable. This is\ndue to the fact that the redefined @_ variable is not reset between\nsuccessive calls. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1323 to this issue. NOTE:\nThis issue does not affect the Perl packages which shipped with Red Hat\nLinux 9.\n\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered in the start_form()\nfunction of CGI.pm. The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to insert a\nWeb script via a URL fed into the form's action parameter. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0615 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Perl are advised to upgrade to the packages contained within this\nerratum. For Red Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3, Perl version 5.6.1 contains\nbackported security patches addressing these issues. For Red Hat Linux 8.0\nand 9, Perl version 5.8.0 is supplied, which is not vulnerable to issue\nCAN-2002-1323 and which contains a backported security patch addressing\nissue CAN-2003-0615.\n    ",
