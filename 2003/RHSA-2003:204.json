These bugs include the use of \na PHP script as an ErrorDocument and possible POST body corruption in some\nconfigurations.\n\nAlso included is a fix for a minor security problem. In PHP version 4.3.1\nand earlier, when transparent session ID support is enabled using the\n\"session.use_trans_sid\" option, the session ID is not escaped before use. \nThis allows a Cross Site Scripting attack.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0442 to\nthis issue.\n\nAll users of PHP are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain back-ported patches to correct these issues.\n    ",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
