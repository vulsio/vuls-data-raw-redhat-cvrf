This issue is known to be exploitable; an exploit (for x86\narchitectures) has been seen in the wild that takes advantage of this\nvulnerability. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0961 to this issue.\n\nThe execve system call in Linux 2.4.x records the file descriptor of the\nexecutable process in the file table of the calling process, which allows\nlocal users to gain read access to restricted file descriptors.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0476 to this issue.\n\nA hangcheck timer (which is used to detect system hangs or pauses) has been\nadded.\n\nIn addition, a number of drivers have been updated:\n\n- e1000 5.2.20-k1\n- cmpci 5.64\n- aic7xxx 6.2.36\n- aic79xx 1.3.10\n- ips 6.10.52\n- cciss 2.4.50\n- fusion 2.05.05+\n\nAll users of IA64 systems should upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain patches to the 2.4.18 kernel addressing these issues.\n    ",
