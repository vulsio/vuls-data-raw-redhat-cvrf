To exploit this vulnerability a local\nattacker would need to be able to get a victim to run man on a carefully\ncrafted man file, and for the attacker to be able to create a file called\n\"unsafe\" that will be on the victims default path.\n\nRed Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 are vulnerable to this issue.  Users\nof man can upgrade to these erratum packages which contain a patch to\ncorrect this vulnerability.  These erratum packages also contain fixes for\na number of other bugs.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
