This could allow an attacker\nto execute a DoS attack via the pipe. This issue is entered in the Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project with the name CVE-2002-0871.\n\nBecause of a programming error, memory was allocated and never freed if a\nconnection was refused for any reason.  An attacker could exploit this flaw\nto crash the xinetd server, rendering all services it controls unavaliable.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0211 to this issue.\n\nIn addition, other flaws in xinetd could cause incorrect operation in\ncertain unusual server configurations.\n\nAll users of xinetd are advised to update to the packages listed in this\nerratum, which contain an upgrade to xinetd-2.3.11 and are not vulnerable\nto these issues.\n    ",
