				"text": "\nThe file command is used to identify a particular file according to the\ntype of data contained in the file.\n\nThe file utility before version 3.41 contains a buffer overflow\nvulnerability in the ELF parsing routines. This vulnerability may\nallow an attacker to create a carefully crafted binary which can allow\narbitrary code to be run if a victim runs the 'file' command on that\nbinary.\n\nThere are other ways that an attacker may be able to take advantage of\nthis vulnerability in the file command:\n\n-- In Red Hat Linux 6.2 and 7.0, the rhs-printfilter package makes use\nof the file command. This would allow an attacker who has the ability\nto print to execute arbitrary commands (as the user 'lp') on the print\nserver by sending a malicious file.\n\n-- On some Red Hat Linux distributions it may also be possible to\ntrigger this exploit by encouraging the victim to use the 'less'\ncommand on a malicious file which is named so that it will be\nprocessed by the 'lesspipe.sh' script.\n\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this vulnerability.  \n\nRed Hat would like to thank iDefense for disclosing this issue and\nzen-parse for discussion of some of the implications.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
