The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0720\nto this issue.\n\nAn integer overflow exists in the Pine MIME header parsing in versions\nprior to 4.57.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2003-0721 to this issue.\n\nBoth of these flaws could be exploited by a remote attacker sending a\ncarefully crafted email to the victim that will execute arbitrary code when\nthe email is opened using Pine.\n\nAll users of Pine are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a backported security patch correcting these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank iDefense for bringing these issues to our\nattention and the University of Washington for the patch.\n    ",
