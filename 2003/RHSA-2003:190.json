				"text": "\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nA number of security issues have been found which affect the version of the\nLinux kernel shipped for iSeries and pSeries systems:\n\nAl Viro found a security issue in the tty layer whereby any user could\ncause a kernel oops. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-0247 to this issue.\n\nMultiple Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC) device drivers do not pad\nframes with null bytes. This allows remote attackers to obtain information\nfrom previous packets or kernel memory by using malformed packets. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0001 to this issue.\n\nThe kernel module loader allows local users to gain root privileges by\nusing ptrace to attach to a child process that is spawned by the kernel.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0127 to this issue.\n\nA flaw has been found in several hash table implementations in the kernel\nnetworking code. A remote attacker could send packets with carefully\nchosen, forged source addresses in such a way as to make every routing\ncache entry get hashed into the same hash chain. The result would be that\nthe kernel would use a disproportionate amount of processor time to deal\nwith new packets, resulting in a remote denial of service attack. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe names CAN-2003-0244 and CAN-2003-0364 to these issues.\n\nNOTE: Installing the kernel RPMs will not automatically prepare the system\nto boot the new kernel. Refer to the following sections for the appropriate\ninstructions to boot the new kernel on your machine.\n\nPreparing to boot the new kernel on iSeries:\n\nAfter the kernel RPM is installed, the new kernel image file is\n/boot/vmlinux. This is a link to the /boot/vmlinux-\"version\" file (where\n\"version\" is the new kernel's version-release).\n\nUse the installkernel.iSeries command to load the new kernel image into the\n\"side\" from which you want to boot. For instance, to boot from the C side,\nuse the command:\n\ninstallkernel.iSeries C /boot/vmlinux\n\nPreparing to boot the new kernel on pSeries:\n\nAfter the kernel RPM is installed, the new kernel image file is\n/boot/vmlinux. This is a link to the /boot/vmlinux-\"version\" file (where\n\"version\" is the new kernel's version-release).\n\nEdit the /etc/yaboot.conf file to instruct YABOOT to boot the new\nkernel. Add a new stanza or change the existing stanza to point to\nthe new kernel image file. The yaboot.conf man page has detailed\ninformation about the format of the yaboot configuration file.\n    ",
