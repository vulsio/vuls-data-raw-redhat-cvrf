If wordwrap() is used on\nuser-supplied input this could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of\nservice or execute arbitrary code.\n\nRed Hat Linux 8.0 shipped with a version of PHP that was vulnerable to this\nissue.  Other Red Hat Linux distributions shipped with an earlier version\nof PHP and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nIn addition, a number of compatiblity bugs have also been found between PHP\n4.2 and Apache 2.0.\n\nAll users of PHP are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages which\ncontain a patch to correct these issues.\n    ",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
