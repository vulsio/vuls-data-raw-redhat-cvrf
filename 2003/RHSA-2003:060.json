These\nbugs could be exploited by creating a carefully crafted image in such a way\nthat it executes arbitrary code when it is processed by either an\napplication from the netpbm-progs package or an application that uses the\nvulnerable netpbm library.\n\nOne way that an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities would be to \nsubmit a carefully crafted image to be printed, as the LPRng print spooler\nused by default in Red Hat Linux releases uses netpbm utilities to parse\nvarious types of image files.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to the erratum packages, which contain patches\nthat correct these vulnerabilities.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
