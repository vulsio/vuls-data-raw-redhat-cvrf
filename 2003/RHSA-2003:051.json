				"text": "\nKerberos is a network authentication system. The MIT Kerberos team\nreleased an advisory describing a number of vulnerabilities that affect the\nkerberos packages shipped by Red Hat. These vulnerabilities include:\n\nAn integer signedness error in the ASN.1 decoder before version 1.2.5\nallows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large\nunsigned data element length, which is later used as a negative value. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0036 to this issue. Red Hat Linux 8.0 and later are not affected\nby this issue.\n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) before version 1.2.5 allows remote,\nauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within\nthe same realm using a certain protocol request that causes a null\ndereference (CAN-2003-0058). Red Hat Linux 8.0 and later are not affected\nby this issue.\n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm using a\ncertain protocol request that causes an out-of-bounds read of an array\n(CAN-2003-0072).\n\nThe Key Distribution Center (KDC) allows remote, authenticated attackers\nto cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm using a\ncertain protocol request that causes the KDC to corrupt its heap\n(CAN-2003-0082).\n\nA vulnerability in Kerberos before version 1.2.3 allows users from one\nrealm to impersonate users in other realms that have the same inter-realm\nkeys (CAN-2003-0059). Red Hat Linux 7.3 and later are not affected by this\nissue.\n\nThe MIT advisory for these issues also mentions format string\nvulnerabilities in the logging routines (CAN-2003-0060). Previous versions\nof the kerberos packages from Red Hat already contain fixes for this issue.\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the support for triple-DES keys in the\nimplementation of the Kerberos IV authentication protocol which is included\nin MIT Kerberos (CAN-2003-0139).\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the Kerberos IV authentication protocol\nwhich allow an attacker with knowledge of a cross-realm key, which is\nshared with another realm, to impersonate any principal in that realm to\nany service in that realm. This vulnerability can only be closed by\ndisabling cross-realm authentication in Kerberos IV (CAN-2003-0138).\n\nVulnerabilities have been found in the RPC library used by the kadmin\nservice in Kerberos 5. A faulty length check in the RPC library exposes\nkadmind to an integer overflow which can be used to crash kadmind\n(CAN-2003-0028).\n\nAll users of Kerberos are advised to upgrade to these errata packages,\nwhich disable cross-realm authentication by default for Kerberos IV and\nwhich contain backported patches that correct these issues.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
