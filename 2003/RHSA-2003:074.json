A remote attacker can send a carefully crafted email message\nwhich, when processed by sendmail, causes arbitrary code to be\nexecuted as root.\n\nWe are advised that a proof-of-concept exploit is known to exist, but\nis not believed to be in the wild.\n\nSince this is a message-based vulnerability, MTAs other than Sendmail\nmay pass on the carefully crafted message.  This means that unpatched\nversions of Sendmail inside a network could still be at risk even if\nthey do not accept external connections directly.\n\nAll users are advised to update to these erratum packages which contain\na backported patch to correct this vulnerability.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Eric Allman for his assistance with this\nvulnerability.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
