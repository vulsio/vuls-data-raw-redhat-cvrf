Two vulnerabilities\nhave been found that affect versions of SquirrelMail shipped with Red Hat\nLinux 8.0.\n\nA cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Squirrelmail version 1.2.10\nand earlier allows remote attackers to execute script as other web users\nvia read_body.php. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1341 to this issue.\n\nAn incomplete fix for a cross-site scripting vulnerability in SquirrelMail\n1.2.8 calls the strip_tags function on the PHP_SELF value but does not save\nthe result back to that variable, leaving it open to cross-site scripting\nattacks. (CAN-2002-1276)\n\nAll users of Squirrelmail are advised to upgrade to these packages\nbased on SquirrelMail version 1.2.10 which contain a backported patch to\nfix these issues.\n    ",
