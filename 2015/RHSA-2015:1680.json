				"text": "\nOpenStack Networking (Neutron) is a pluggable, scalable, and API-driven\nsystem that provisions networking services to virtual machines. Its main\nfunction is to manage connectivity to and from virtual machines.\n\nA Denial of Service flaw was found in the L2 agent when using the IPTables\nfirewall driver. By submitting an address pair that will be rejected as\ninvalid by the ipset tool, an attacker may cause the agent to crash.\n(CVE-2015-3221)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack upstream for reporting this\nissue. Upstream acknowledges Darragh O'Reilly (HP) as the original reporter.\n\nAdditionally, the packages address the following issues:\n* Neutron failed to load multiple configuration files. The Puppet recipe\nhard-coded the --config-file parameter to a set list of configuration files\nand additional files were not loaded, even if specified. This fix creates a\nnew Neutron configuration directory, /etc/neutron/conf.d, and any .conf\nfiles in that directory are loaded by Puppet and applied to all services.\n(BZ#1188480)\n\n* When configuring load balancer as a service, the Neutron configuration\nused no group as the default system user group. This group does not exist\nin the default Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 configuration, which caused the\nvirtual IP address creation to fail with the error \"cannot find group id\nfor 'nogroup'.\" (BZ#1208002)\n\n* Log rotation was set to one week for Neutron, but that could allow the\nlog file to grow to be very large before rotating. The default log rotation\npolicy has been updated to include a size limit of 10MB as well as a time\nlimit to rotate daily. (BZ#1212442)\n\n* Previously, dnsmasq did not save lease information in persistent storage.\nWhen it was restarted, the lease information was lost. This behavior\nresulted from removing the '--dhcp-script' option as part of fixing\nBZ#1202392. As a result, instances were stuck in the network boot process\nfor a long period of time. In addition, NACK messages were noted in the\ndnsmasq log. This update removes the authoritative option, so that NAKs are\nnot sent in response to DHCPREQUESTs to other servers. This change is\nexpected to prevent dnsmasq from NAKing clients renewing leases issued\nbefore it was restarted/rescheduled. DHCPNAK messages should no longer be\nfound in the log files. (BZ#1227635)\n\n* Conflict tags were included in the python-neutron package spec that\nresulted in Neutron unnecessarily blocking the python-oslo-db package.\nThese conflicts have been removed from the spec, so the python-oslo-db\npackage can be successfully installed. (BZ#1250056)\n\nAll openstack-neutron users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.\n    ",
