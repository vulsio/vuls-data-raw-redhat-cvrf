				"text": "\nPackStack is a command-line utility for deploying OpenStack on existing\nservers over an SSH connection. Deployment options are provided either\ninteractively, using the command line, or non-interactively by means of a\ntext file containing a set of preconfigured values for OpenStack\nparameters. PackStack is suitable for proof-of-concept installations.\nPackStack is suitable for deploying proof-of-concept installations.\n\nIt was discovered that the puppet manifests, as provided with the\nopenstack-puppet-modules package, would configure the pcsd daemon with a\nknown default password. If this password was not changed and an attacker\nwas able to gain access to pcsd, they could potentially run shell commands\nas root. (CVE-2015-1842)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Alessandro Vozza of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* If OpenStack Networking is enabled, Packstack would display a warning if\nthe Network Manager service is active on hosts. (BZ#1117277)\n\n* A quiet dependency on a newer version of selinux-policy causes\nopenstack-selinux 0.6.23 to fail to install modules when paired with\nselinux-policy packages from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.0 or 7.0.z.\nThis causes Identity and other OpenStack services to receive 'AVC' denials\nand malfunction under some circumstances. The following workarounds allow\nthe OpenStack services to function correctly:\n\n1) Leave openstack-selinux at 0.6.18-2.el7ost until you are ready to update\nto Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1. At that time, a 'yum update' will resolve\nthe issue.\n\n2) Install the updated selinux-policy and selinux-policy-targeted packages\nfrom Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 (version selinux-policy-3.13.1-23.el7 or\nlater), then update openstack-selinux to version 0.6.23-1.el7ost.\n(BZ#1195252)\n\n* A typo in the code caused a Sahara option that uses OpenStack Networking\nto be always false. Sahara now uses OpenStack Networking if the parameter\n'CONFIG_NEUTRON_INSTALL is set to 'y'. (BZ#1199047)\n\n* Prior to this update, users had to install the OpenStack Unified Client\nseparately after an installation of Packstack. Packstack now installs it by\ndefault. (BZ#1199114)\n\n* This enhancement updates Packstack to retain temporary directories when\nrunning an installation in debug mode. This assists with troubleshooting\nactivities. As a result, temporary directories are not deleted when running\nPackstack with the --debug command line option. (BZ#1199565)\n\n* Prior to this update, some validators did not use 'validate_not_empty' to\nensure that certain parameters contained values. As a result, a number of\ninternal validations could not be properly handled, leading to the\npossibility of unexpected errors. This update fixes validators to use\nvalidate_not_empty when required, resulting in correct validation behavior\nfrom validators. (BZ#11995889)\n\nIn addition to the above issues, this update also addresses bugs and\nenhancements which can be found in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack\nPlatform Technical Notes, linked to in the References section.\n\nAll openstack-packstack and openstack-puppet-modules users are advised to\nupgrade to these updated packages, which correct these issues.\n    ",
