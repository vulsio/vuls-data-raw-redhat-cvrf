The service's distributed architecture supports horizontal scaling;\nredundancy as failure-proofing is provided through software-based data\nreplication. Because Object Storage supports asynchronous eventual\nconsistency replication, it is well suited to multiple data-center\ndeployment.\n\nA flaw was found in openstack-swift where an authenticated user may \ndelete the most recent version of a versioned object regardless of \nownership. To exploit this flaw an attacker most know the name of the \nobject and have listing access to the x-versions-location container. \n(CVE-2015-1856)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting this \nissue. Upstream acknowledges Clay Gerrard of SwiftStack as the \noriginal reporter.\n\nAll users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct this issue. After installing this update, the\nOpenStack Object Storage services will be restarted automatically.\n    ",
