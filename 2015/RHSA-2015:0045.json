Accordingly, Red Hat will no longer provide\nupdated packages, including Critical impact security patches or urgent\npriority bug fixes, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform version\n4.0 after June 19, 2015. In addition, technical support through Red Hat's\nGlobal Support Services will no longer be provided after this date.\n\nWe encourage customers to upgrade to the latest version of Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux OpenStack Platform as soon as possible. As of the End of\nLife date, this is expected to be the 6.0 version, based on the upstream\nJuno release, and will be supported for 3 years. In addition, the 5.0\nversion will continue to be in the Production Support phase until its End\nof Life on June 29, 2017. As a benefit of the Red Hat subscription model,\ncustomers can use their active subscriptions to entitle any system on a\ncurrently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform version.\n\nDetails of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform life cycle can\nbe found here:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/openstack/platform/\n    ",
