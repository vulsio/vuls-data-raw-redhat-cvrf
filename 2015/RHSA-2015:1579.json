(CVE-2015-3010, CVE-2015-4053)\n\nceph has been upgraded from v0.80.8.1 to v0.80.8.2. This upgrade fixes the following bugs:\n\n- .rgw pool contains extra objects (rhbz #1212524)\n- rgw bucket/object owner override when setting acls (rhbz #1214051)\n- librbd: aio calls may block (rhbz #1225172)\n\nice_setup has been upgraded from v0.3.0-2 to v0.3.2. This upgrade fixes a bug where ice_setup would crash if the \"setuptools\" Python package was not already installed on the Calamari admin node. (rhbz #1212045)\n\nAll ceph-deploy users are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.\n    ",
