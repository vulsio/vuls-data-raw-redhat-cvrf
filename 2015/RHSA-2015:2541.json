(CVE-2015-7501)\n\nFurther information about the commons-collections flaw may be found at:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/solutions/2045023\n\nIt was found that JBoss EAP did not properly authorize a user performing a\nshut down. A remote user with the Monitor, Deployer, or Auditor role could\nuse this flaw to shut down the EAP server, which is an action restricted to\nadmin users. (CVE-2015-5304)\n\nThe CVE-2015-5304 issue was discovered by Ladislav Thon of Red Hat\nMiddleware Quality Engineering.\n\nThis release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform 6.4.4, and includes bug fixes and enhancements.\nDocumentation for these changes is available from the link in the\nReferences section.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.4 as provided\nfrom the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.\n    ",
