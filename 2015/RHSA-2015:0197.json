				"text": "\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides access to virtual\nmachines using SPICE. These SPICE client packages provide the SPICE client\nand usbclerk service for both Windows 32-bit operating systems and Windows\n64-bit operating systems.\n\nA race condition was found in the way OpenSSL handled ServerHello messages\nwith an included Supported EC Point Format extension. A malicious server\ncould possibly use this flaw to cause a multi-threaded TLS/SSL client using\nOpenSSL to write into freed memory, causing the client to crash or execute\narbitrary code. (CVE-2014-3509)\n\nA flaw was found in the way OpenSSL handled fragmented handshake packets.\nA man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to force a TLS/SSL server\nusing OpenSSL to use TLS 1.0, even if both the client and the server\nsupported newer protocol versions. (CVE-2014-3511)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, various clipboard managers, operating on the client or on the\nguest, would occasionally lose synchronization, which resulted in clipboard\ndata loss and the SPICE console freezing. Now, spice-gtk have been patched,\nsuch that clipboard synchronization does not freeze the SPICE console\nanymore. (BZ#1083489)\n\n* Prior to this update, when a SPICE console was launched from the Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization User Portal with the 'Native Client' invocation\nmethod and 'Open in Full Screen' selected, the displays of the guest\nvirtual machine were not always configured to match the client displays.\nAfter this update, the SPICE console will show a full-screen guest display\nfor each client monitor. (BZ#1076243)\n\n* A difference in behavior between Linux and Windows clients caused an\nextra nul character to be sent when pasting text in a guest machine from a\nWindows client. This invisible character was visible in some Java\napplications. With this update, the extra nul character is removed from\ntext strings and no more extraneous character would appear. (BZ#1090122)\n\n* Previously, If the clipboard is of type image/bmp, and the data is of 0\nsize, GTK+ will crash. With this update, the data size is checked first,\nand GTK+ no longer crashes when clipboard is of type image/bmp, and the\ndata is of 0 size. (BZ#1090433)\n\n* Modifier-only key combinations cannot be registered by users as hotkeys\nso if a user tries to set a modifier-only key sequence (for example,\n'ctrl+alt') as the hotkey for releasing the cursor, it will fail, and the\nuser will be able to release the cursor from the window. With this update,\nwhen a modifier-only hotkey is attempted to be registered, it will fall\nback to the default cursor-release sequence (which happens to be\n'ctrl+alt'). (BZ#985319)\n\n* Display configuration sometimes used outdated information about the\nposition of the remote-viewer windows in order to align and configure the\nguest displays. Occasionally, this caused the guest displays to became\nunexpectedly swapped when a window is resized. With this update,\nremote-viewer will always use the current window locations to align\ndisplays, rather than using a possibly outdated cached location\ninformation. (BZ#1018182)\n\nAll rhevm-spice-client users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.\n    ",
