				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\n* It was found that the Linux kernel's implementation of vectored pipe read\nand write functionality did not take into account the I/O vectors that were\nalready processed when retrying after a failed atomic access operation,\npotentially resulting in memory corruption due to an I/O vector array\noverrun. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system\nor, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-1805,\nImportant)\n\nThe security impact of this issue was discovered by Red Hat.\n\nThis update fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Due to a bug in the lpfc_device_reset_handler() function, a scsi command\ntimeout could lead to a system crash. With this update,\nlpfc_device_reset_handler recovers storage without crashing. (BZ#1070964)\n\n* Due to the code decrementing the reclaim_in_progress counter without\nhaving incremented it first, severe spinlock contention occurred in the\nshrink_zone() function even though the vm.max_reclaims_in_progress feature\nwas set to 1. This update provides a patch fixing the underlying source\ncode, and spinlock contention no longer occurs in this scenario.\n(BZ#1164105)\n\n* A TCP socket using SACK that had a retransmission but recovered from it,\nfailed to reset the retransmission timestamp. As a consequence, on certain\nconnections, if a packet had to be re-transmitted, the retrans_stamp\nvariable was only cleared when the next acked packet was received.\nThis could lead to an early abortion of the TCP connection if this next\npacket also got lost. With this update, the socket clears retrans_stamp\nwhen the recovery is completed, thus fixing the bug. (BZ#1205521)\n\n* Previously, the signal delivery paths did not clear the TS_USEDFPU flag,\nwhich could cause problems in the switch_to() function and lead to\nfloating-point unit (FPU) corruption. With this update, TS_USEDFPU is\ncleared as expected, and FPU is no longer under threat of corruption.\n(BZ#1193505)\n\n* A race condition in the exit_sem() function previously caused the\nsemaphore undo list corruption. As a consequence, a kernel crash could\noccur. The corruption in the semaphore undo list has been fixed, and the\nkernel no longer crashes in this situation. (BZ#1124574)\n\n* Previously, when running the \"virsh blockresize [Device] [Newsize]\"\ncommand to resize the disk, the new size was not reflected in a Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5 Virtual Machine (VM). With this update, the new size is\nnow reflected online immediately in a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 VM so it\nis no longer necessary to reboot the VM to see the new disk size.\n(BZ#1200855)\n\nAll kernel users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\ncontain backported patches to correct these issues. The system must be\nrebooted for this update to take effect.\n    ",
