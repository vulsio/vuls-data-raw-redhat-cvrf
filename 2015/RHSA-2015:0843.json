Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores, which give\ndetailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability from the\nCVE links in the References section.\n    ",

				"text": "\nOpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual\nmachines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform.\nCompute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to\norchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and\ncontrolling access through users and projects.\n\nIt was discovered that the OpenStack Compute (nova) console websocket did\nnot correctly verify the origin header. An attacker could use this flaw to\nconduct a cross-site websocket hijack attack. Note that only Compute setups\nwith VNC or SPICE enabled were affected by this flaw. (CVE-2015-0259)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way OpenStack Compute (nova)\nlooked up VM instances based on an IP address filter. An attacker with\nsufficient privileges on an OpenStack installation with a large amount of\nVMs could use this flaw to cause the main nova process to block for an\nextended amount of time. (CVE-2014-3708)\n\nA flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute (nova) VMWare driver, which could\nallow an authenticated user to delete an instance while it was in the\nresize state, causing the instance to remain on the back end. A malicious\nuser could use this flaw to cause a denial of service by exhausting all\navailable resources on the system. (CVE-2014-8333)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting the\nCVE-2015-0259 and CVE-2014-3708 issues. Upstream acknowledges Brian\nManifold of Cisco and Paul McMillan of Nebula as the original reporters of\nCVE-2015-0259, and Mohammed Naser from Vexxhost as the original reporter of\nCVE-2014-3708.\n\nIn addition to the above issues, this update also addresses several bugs\nand adds various enhancements, which are documented in the Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux OpenStack Platform Technical Notes (see References section).\n\nAll openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct these issues and add these enhancements.\n    ",
