A remote attacker could use this flaw to view \nsensitive information via pod logs that they would normally not have \naccess to. (CVE-2015-7528)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Jordan Liggitt of Red Hat Atomic OpenShift.\n\nTo use the latest 'openshift3/ose:v3.1.0.4' image with the ID \n\"d4caa301790e\" simply run the following command:\n\ndocker pull registry.access.redhat.com/openshift3/ose:v3.1.0.4\n\nand then restart any containers based on this image.\n\nAll OpenShift Enterprise 3.0 and 3.1 users are advised to upgrade to \nthese updated images, which correct this issue.\n    ",
