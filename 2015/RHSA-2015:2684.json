A remote attacker could use this flaw to\naccess running VM instances. (CVE-2015-7713)\n\nAdditional bug fixes include:\n\n* In some cases, Compute did not start instances when RHEL was \ninstalled with a locale other than en_US. The update ensures that \nlogging an exception no longer causes Unicode issues. (BZ#1190837)\n\nAll openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated \npackages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.\n    ",
