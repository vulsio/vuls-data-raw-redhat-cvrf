				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that\nprovides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss\nEnterprise Middleware, applications, and services.\n\nThis JBoss Operations Network 3.3.2 release serves as a replacement for\nJBoss Operations Network 3.3.1, and includes several bug fixes. Refer to\nthe Customer Portal page linked in the References section for information\non the most significant of these changes.\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was discovered that the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation\ndid not sufficiently verify all authorization conditions that are required\nby the Maintainer role to perform certain administrative actions.\nAn authenticated user with the Maintainer role could use this flaw to add,\nmodify, or undefine a limited set of attributes and their values, which\notherwise cannot be written to. (CVE-2014-7849)\n\nIt was discovered that the JBoss Application Server (WildFly) JacORB\nsubsystem incorrectly assigned socket-binding-ref sensitivity\nclassification for the security-domain attribute. An authenticated user\nwith a role that has access to attributes with socket-binding-ref and not\nsecurity-domain-ref sensitivity classification could use this flaw to\naccess sensitive information present in the security-domain attribute.\n(CVE-2014-7853)\n\nIt was discovered that under specific conditions the conversation state\ninformation stored in a thread-local variable in JBoss Weld was not\nsanitized correctly when the conversation ended. This could lead to a race\ncondition that could potentially expose sensitive information from a\nprevious conversation to the current conversation. (CVE-2014-8122)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Rune Steinseth of JProfessionals for reporting\nCVE-2014-8122. The CVE-2014-7849 and CVE-2014-7853 issues were\ndiscovered by Darran Lofthouse of the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application\nPlatform Team.\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.3.1 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.3.2.\n    ",
