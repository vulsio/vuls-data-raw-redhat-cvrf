				"text": "\nOpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) provides administrators and users with a\ngraphical interface to access, provision, and automate cloud-based\nresources.\n\nTwo security issues were discovered in the Horizon dashboard and are\naddressed in this update: \n\n* A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the Horizon Orchestration\ndashboard. An attacker able to trick a Horizon user into using a malicious\ntemplate during the stack creation could use this flaw to perform an XSS\nattack on that user. (CVE-2015-3219)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting the\nCVE-2015-3219 issue. Upstream acknowledges Nikita Konovalov from Mirantis\nas the original reporter of CVE-2015-3219.\n\n* A flaw was discovered in the Horizon metadata dashboard whereby\npotentially untrusted data was displayed from Glance images, Nova flavors,\nor host aggregates without correct clean up. An attacker could use this\nflaw to conduct an XSS attack.(CVE-2015-3988)\n\nAdditionally, the following non-security issues are addressed:\n\n* It was impossible to associate a floating IP address to a port for an\ninstance. This occurred if the gateway router was not in the same tenant as\nthe instance but was attached to a network shared across tenants because\nonly ports within the tenant were used to find reachable gateway routers.\n(BZ#1187992)\n\n* If two or more regions were configured in Horizon, then the User, Help,\nand Current Project links would no longer work and the region selector\nwas in the wrong location in the UI. (BZ#1189887)\n\n* A load balancer monitor was erroneously displayed as associated with\nevery tenant in every pool. The load balancer monitor was not actually\nassociated with any tenants, but the improper display prevented users \nfrom using the Horizon dashboard to create a tenant association.\n(BZ#1196249)\n\n* When logging into the Horizon dashboard, Horizon sends a query to Nova to\nupdate usage statistics. One of the calls would erroneously query deleted\nvirtual machines; if there were thousands of deleted virtual machines, the\nCPU usage for Nova would spike and the Nova process could crash.\n(BZ#1243301)\n\n* The network profile was not supported by Cisco N1KV ML2 drivers. This\nprofile has been removed to maintain Horizon compatibility with the Cisco\ndriver. (BZ#1246690)\n\n* A neutron attribute extension was renamed from profile_id to profile for\nnetworks and ports. This caused create operations for networks and ports to\nfail from the dashboard since the dashboard was still using the attribute\nname n1kv:profile_id rather than n1kv:profile.(BZ#1248367)\n\n* If a virtual machine instance failed to launch, then the stale port\nassignments were left in the configuration rather than being cleaned up.\n(BZ#1249228)\n\nAll python-django-horizon users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.\n    ",
