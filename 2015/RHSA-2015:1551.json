It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in the\nREADME file included with the patch files.\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that async-http-client would disable SSL/TLS certificate\nverification under certain conditions, for example if HTTPS communication\nalso used client certificates. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could\nuse this flaw to spoof a valid certificate. (CVE-2013-7397)\n\nIt was found that async-http-client did not verify that the server hostname\nmatched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName\nfield in X.509 certificates. This could allow a man-in-the-middle attacker\nto spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate that was valid for any\ndomain name. (CVE-2013-7398)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6.0.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.\n    ",
