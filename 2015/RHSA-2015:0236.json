It includes bug fixes, which are documented in the readme.txt file\nincluded with the patch files. The following security issues are addressed\nin this release:\n\nIt was found that Apache WSS4J (Web Services Security for Java), as used by\nApache CXF with the TransportBinding, did not, by default, properly enforce\nall security requirements associated with SAML SubjectConfirmation methods.\nA remote attacker could use this flaw to perform various types of spoofing\nattacks on web service endpoints secured by WSS4J that rely on SAML for\nauthentication. (CVE-2014-3623)\n\nA directory traversal flaw was found in the way the Spring Framework\nsanitized certain URLs. A remote attacker could use this flaw to obtain any\nfile on the file system that was also accessible to the process in which\nthe Spring web application was running. (CVE-2014-3625)\n\nRefer to the readme.txt file included with the patch files for\ninstallation instructions.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.1.0 as\nprovided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this\nsecurity update.\n    ",
