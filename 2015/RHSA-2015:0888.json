				"text": "\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally\nmanaging collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nand Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give\nadministrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Manager.\n\nThe Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several\ninterfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and\ninteracted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a\nRepresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface\n(API).\n\nIt was discovered that the permissions to allow or deny snapshot creation\nwere ignored during live storage migration of a VM's disk between storage\ndomains. An attacker able to live migrate a disk between storage domains\ncould use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-0237)\n\nIt was discovered that a directory shared between the ovirt-engine-dwhd\nservice and a plug-in used during the service's startup had incorrect\npermissions. A local user could use this flaw to access files in this\ndirectory, which could potentially contain sensitive information. \n(CVE-2015-0257)\n\nThe CVE-2015-0237 issue was discovered by Red Hat Enterprise Visualization\nEngineering, and the CVE-2015-0257 issue was discovered by Yedidyah Bar\nDavid of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization team.\n\nThese updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager packages also\ninclude numerous bug fixes and various enhancements. Space precludes\ndocumenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are directed to\nthe Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3.5 Technical Notes, linked to in the\nReferences, for information on the most significant of these changes.\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade\nto these updated packages, which resolve these issues and add these\nenhancements.\n    ",
