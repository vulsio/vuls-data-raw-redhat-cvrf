A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which\ngives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in the\nReferences section.\n    ",

				"text": "\nOpenStack Dashboard (horizon) provides administrators and users a graphical\ninterface to access, provision and automate cloud-based resources.\nThe dashboard allows cloud administrators to get an overall view of the\nsize and state of the cloud and it provides end-users a self-service portal\nto provision their own resources within the limits set by administrators.\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the OpenStack Dashboard (horizon)\nwhen using the db or memcached session engine. An attacker could make\nrepeated requests to the login page, which would result in a large number\nof unwanted backend session entries, possibly leading to a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2014-8124)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Eric Peterson from Time Warner Cable as the original\nreporter.\n\nThe python-django-horizon packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2014.1.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version,\nincluding:\n\n* Default 'target={}' value leaks into subsequent 'policy.check()' calls.\n* Neutron subnet create tooltip has invalid HTML tags.\n* Memory reported improperly in admin dashboard.\n* The container dashboard does not handle unicode URL correctly.\n(BZ#1203281)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The option 'OPENSTACK_SSL_NO_VERIFY' is used to enable or disable checks\nfor SSL certificate validity. Prior to this update, swift clients ignored\nthis check. As a result, you could not use horizon with swift, and swift\nwas accessed via a self signed certificate. With this update, the option is\nnow handled properly and Horizon is able to use this endpoint while the\n'OPENSTACK_SSL_NO_VERIFY' option is enabled. (BZ#1192517)\n\n* Previously, horizon.log was not truncated automatically, resulting in\nvery large log files. With this update, files are now trimmed by logrotate,\nfixing this issue. (BZ#1112621)\n\nAll OpenStack Dashboard users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues.\n    ",
