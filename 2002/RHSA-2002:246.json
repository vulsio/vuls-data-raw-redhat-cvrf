The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1158 to this issue.\n\nA lack of validation of requests has been found that affects Canna version\n3.6 and earlier.  A malicious remote user could exploit this vulnerability\nto leak information, or cause a denial of service attack.  (CAN-2002-1159)\n\nRed Hat Linux 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 ship with a Canna package vulnerable\nto these issues; however, the package is normally only installed when\nJapanese language support is selected during installation.\n\nAll users of Canna are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain a backported security fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank hsj and AIDA Shinra for the responsible\ndisclosure of these issues.\n    ",
