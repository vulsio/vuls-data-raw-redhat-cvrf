A remote user can crash\nthe rsync server/client and execute code as the user running the rsync\nserver or client.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0048 to this issue.\n\nAll users of rsync should upgrade their packages.  In addition rsync server\nadministrators should consider using the \"use chroot\", \"uid\",  and \"read\nonly\" options, which can significantly reduce the impact of a security\nproblem in rsync or elsewhere.\n\nThanks go to Sebastian Krahmer for providing a patch for this vulnerability\nand to Andrew Tridgell and Martin Pool for their rapid response.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
