				"text": "\nThe pam_ldap module provides authentication for user access to a system by\nconsulting a directory using LDAP. Versions of pam_ldap prior to version\n144 include a format string bug in the logging function. The packages\nincluded in this erratum update pam_ldap to version 144, fixing this bug.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0374 to this issue.\n\nDue to differences in the default behavior of the pam_ldap module when\nperforming account management, the version of authconfig included in Red\nRat Linux 7.2 generates incorrect /etc/pam.d/system-auth files for \nthe version of pam_ldap included in this erratum.  Thus, an updated \nversion of authconfig for Red Hat Linux 7.2 is included in this erratum \n(versions of authconfig included with Red Hat Linux 7, 7.1, and 7.3 are not\naffected).\n\nOur thanks go to the pam_ldap team at padl.com for bringing this to our\nattention.\n\nA previous revision of this erratum included packages which could not be\ninstalled with the version of RPM included with Red Hat Linux 6.2.  While\nthey can be installed with versions of RPM which have been released as\nerrata for Red Hat Linux 6.2, this revision includes packages which remove\nthis restriction.  Packages for Red Hat Linux 7, 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 have not\nbeen modified.\n    ",
