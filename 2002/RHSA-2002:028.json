This component\nis distributed with kernels in Red Hat Linux 7.1 and 7.2, although it is\nnot used in default installations.\n\nThe problem consists of an excessively broad netmask setting which is\napplied to check if an \"IRC DCC\" connection through a masquerading firewall\nshould be allowed. This results in unwanted ports being opened on the\nfirewall, which could, depending on the firewall filter ruleset, allow\ninbound connections.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0060 to this issue.  Thanks to Jozsef Kadlecsik\nand Harald Welte of the netfilter team.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this errata kernel containing patches\nwhich fix these issues.\n    ",

						"text": "\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied. Red Hat Linux 7.1 users should\nupdate the packages in the XFree86 Erratum (RHEA-2002:010).\n\nThe procedure for upgrading the kernel is documented at:\n\nhttp://www.redhat.com/support/docs/howto/kernel-upgrade/\n\nPlease read the directions for your architecture carefully before\nproceeding with the kernel upgrade.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this to be an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat\nNetwork, launch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system. Note that you need to select the kernel\nexplicitly on default configurations of up2date.\n\nNote for customers using Red Hat Linux for the IBM s/390:\n\nUsers of Red Hat Linux for the IBM s/390 with binary only kernel modules\n(OCO) should contact their vendor to obtain updated modules for this kernel\npatch.\n    ",
