				"text": "\nThe libpng package contains a library of functions for creating and\nmanipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files. PNG\nis a bit-mapped graphics format similar to the GIF format. \n\nVersions of libpng prior to 1.0.14 contain a buffer overflow in the\nprogressive reader when the PNG datastream contains more IDAT data than\nindicated by the IHDR chunk.  Such deliberately malformed datastreams would\ncrash applications that are linked to libpng and that use the progressive\nreading feature. Mozilla is such an application.  (CAN-2002-0728)\n\nPackages within Red Hat Linux, such as Mozilla, make use of the shared\nlibpng library. Therefore, all users are advised to upgrade to the errata\npackages which contain libpng 1.0.14.  Libpng 1.0.14 is not vulnerable to\nthis issue and contains fixes for other bugs, including a number of memory\nleaks and another potential buffer overflow (CAN-2002-0660)\n    ",
