The Sun\nimplementation was recently demonstrated to be vulnerable to a heap\noverflow.  It is believed that the attacker needs to be able to\nauthenticate to the kadmin daemon for this attack to be successful.  No\nexploits are known to currently exist.\n\nAll users should upgrade to these errata packages which contain an updated\nversion of Kerberos 5 which is not vulnerable to this issue.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
