Since the at command is installed as setuid\nroot this bug can be exploited.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities  and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0004 to this issue.  Thanks to zen-parse for\nreporting this vulnerability.\n\nIn addition to the fixed heap corruption, file handling security on all\nversions of at has been improved by adding the O_EXCL (exclusive) option to\nan open system call.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
