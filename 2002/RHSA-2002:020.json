This overflow could be locally exploited if the library is\nlinked into a program that runs setuid or setgid.\n\nRed Hat Linux ships with a compatibility package 'ncurses4' that is\nactually based on ncurses version 5.0 but has been made ABI compatible\nwith ncurses 4.\n\nNo programs that ship with Red Hat Linux are exploitable.  A program could\nonly be exploited if it uses the ncurses 4 compatiblity package and if it\nis run setuid or setgid.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0062 to this issue.  Thanks to Daniel\nJacobowitz at MontaVista Software for alerting us to this issue.\n    ",

To use Red Hat \nNetwork, \nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command: \n \nup2date \n \nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the \nappropriate \nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
