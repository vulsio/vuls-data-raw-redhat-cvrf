				"text": "\nVersions of PostgreSQL 6.5.x to 7.1.3 are vulnerable to a security issue.\n\nDue to a bug in PostgreSQL's multi-byte support, users of any database\nclient application that builds database queries from user input may enable\na user to cause the database server to execute arbitrary SQL commands. Red\nHat Database 7.1 is based on PostgreSQL 7.1 and is vulnerable to this\nattack. Details of the vulnerability are as follows:\n\nIf a client using a character encoding other than SQL_ASCII passes a query\nto a multi-byte enabled database server using the default SQL_ASCII\nencoding, then any character in the query string not representable by the\nSQL_ASCII encoding will cause the character immediately following the\nunrepresentable character to be lost during character set conversion.\n\nSome applications form their SQL queries by populating a template query\nwith text input from the user. This character conversion bug can be used by\nan attacker to suppress characters in the application's template query\nstring and force user input components of a database query to be\ninterpreted only as literal text. It is then possible for the user input\ndata to be interpreted as query text, resulting in the execution of\narbitrary SQL.\n\nRed Hat Database 7.1 shipped with a vulnerable version of PostgreSQL and\nhas multi-byte support enabled by default. This update incorporates the\npatch for this issue as provided by Tatsuo Ishii on the pgsql-hackers\nmailing list.\n\nThis update also contains fixes for several PostgreSQL bugs, including\nproblems related to write-ahead logging (WAL) of sequences,\nbackup with pg_dump of user defined aggregates that have a null initial\ncondition, and handling of long literals in plpgsql. \n\nAll users of Red Hat Database are advised to apply this update to remedy\nthe outlined vulnerability.\n    ",
