				"text": "\nThe Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) provides a portable printing\nlayer.  A number of vulnerabilities have been discovered in CUPS.\n\nCUPS was distributed with Red Hat Linux 7.3 and 8.0 but is not\ninstalled by default.\n\n1. An integer overflow exists in the CUPS HTTP interface that allows\na local attacker to gain the permissions of the 'lp' user.  (CAN-2002-1383)\n\n2. A race condition exists in the creation of a pid file which allows\nan attacker who already has privileges of the 'lp' user (for example from\nutilizing a different exploit) to create or overwrite any file as\nroot, leading to arbitrary code execution.  (CAN-2002-1366)\n\n3. It is possible to remotely add a printer to CUPS by sending a\nspecially crafted UDP packet.  If an attacker utilizes this vulnerability,\nthey could add a printer with a tainted name that if clicked on in the\nweb administration interface could be used to exploit other\nvulnerabilities.  (CAN-2002-1367)\n\nBy utilizing this vulnerability, an attacker could take a number of steps\nto be able to get hold of the certificate used to access the administrative\nsection of the CUPS server and potentially add a printer that will execute\ncommands with root privileges.\n\n4. Problems with chunked encoding and negative content length handling\nin the CUPS HTTP interface can cause CUPS to crash.  On Red Hat Linux\nplatforms this can cause a denial of service (DoS) against CUPS. \n(CAN-2002-1368)\n\n5. A number of integer overflows exist in the image handling code of\nthe filters in CUPS.  In addition, CUPS does not properly check for\nzero width GIF images. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker who has\nthe ability to print to run arbitrary code as the 'lp' user.  (CAN-2002-1371)\n\n6. An integer overflow exists in the CUPS pdftops filter.  This can be\nexploited by an attacker who is able to print sending a carefully\ncrafted PDF file which can execute arbitrary commands as the 'lp' user.\n(CAN-2002-1384)\n\n7. A buffer overflow exists in setting up the job management options.\nWhen combined with other vulnerabilities, this could allow a local user\nto gain root privileges.  This issue only affects the version of CUPS\nshipped with Red Hat Linux 7.3.  (CAN-2002-1369)\n\n8. A bug in the select() call would allow an easy DoS attack which would\ncause CUPS to not recover once the DoS has stopped. (CAN-2002-1372)\n\nRed Hat Linux 7.3 and 8.0 were shipped with versions of CUPS that are\nvulnerable to these issues. All users of CUPS are advised to upgrade to the\nerratum packages which contain a patch to correct these issue.\n    ",
