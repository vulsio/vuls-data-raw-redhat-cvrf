(CAN-2002-0834)\n\nBuffer overflows in Ethereal 0.9.4 and earlier allow remote attackers\nto cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via (1) the BGP\ndissector, or (2) the WCP dissector. (CAN-2002-0821)\n\nEthereal 0.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial\nof service and possibly execute arbitrary code via the (1) SOCKS, (2)\nRSVP, (3) AFS, or (4) LMP dissectors, which can be caused to core\ndump.
