(CAN-2002-0687)\n\nZCatalog plug-in index support capability for Zope 2.4.0 through 2.5.1\nallows anonymous users and untrusted code to bypass access\nrestrictions and call arbitrary methods of catalog indexes. (CAN-2002-0688)\n\nZope 2.2.0 through 2.5.1 does not properly verify the access for objects\nwith proxy roles, which could allow some users to access documents in\nviolation of the intended configuration. (CAN-2002-0170)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these errata packages that have the Zope \nHotfixes 2002-03-01, 2002-04-15, and 2002-06-14 applied, and are therefore\nnot vulnerable to these issues.\n    ",
