An attacker can create a carefully crafted\nmalformed PDF or PostScript file in such a way that when that file is\nviewed arbitrary commands can be executed.\n\nAll users of ggv are advised to upgrade to the errata packages which\ncontain a patch and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
