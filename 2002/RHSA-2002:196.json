The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the name CAN-2002-0871 to this issue.\n\nRed Hat Linux 7.3 shipped with xinetd version 2.3.4 and is therefore\nvulnerable to this issue.  All users are advised to upgrade to the errata\npackages which fix the vulnerability.\n\nThanks to Solar Designer for discovering this issue.\n    ",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
