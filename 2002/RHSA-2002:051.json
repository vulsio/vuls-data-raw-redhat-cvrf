				"text": "\nSquid is a high-performance proxy caching server. The following summary\ndescribes the various issues found and their resolutions.\n\nA problem was found in the code used by Squid to handle compressed DNS\nreplies where a malicious DNS server could cause Squid to crash. This bug\nis fixed in the 2.4.STABLE6 release of Squid.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-0163\nto this issue. Note that Red Hat Linux 7.3 is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nSeveral buffer overflows have been found in the MSNT auth helper\n(msnt_auth) when configured to use denyusers or allowusers access control\nfiles.\n\nSeveral buffer overflows were found in the gopher client of Squid. It\ncould be possible for a malicious gopher server to cause Squid to crash.\n\nA problem was found in the handling of the FTP data channel, possibly\nallowing abuse of the FTP proxy to bypass firewall rules or inject false\nFTP replies.\n\nSeveral possible buffer overflows were found in the code parsing FTP\ndirectories, potentially allowing an untrusted FTP server to crash Squid.\n\nThanks go to Olaf Kirch and the Squid team for notifying us of the\nproblems, and to the Squid team for providing patches.\n\nNote that Carp support has been disabled in this errata. If you need Carp\nsupport, you can reconfigure it with --enable-carp and rebuild the packages.\n\nAll users of Squid are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain patches to correct each of these issues.\n    ",
