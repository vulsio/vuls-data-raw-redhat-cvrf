This\nmay allow a malicious server or client to cause an affected application to\ncrash or enter an infinite loop, which can be used as a denial of service\n(DoS) attack if the application is a server. It has not been verified if\nthis issue could lead to further consequences such as remote code execution.\n\nThese errata packages contain a patch to correct this vulnerability. \nPlease note that the original patch from the OpenSSL team had a mistake in\nit which could possibly still allow buffer overflows to occur.  This bug is\nalso fixed in these errata packages.\n\nNOTE:\n\nPlease read the Solution section below as it contains instructions for\nmaking sure that all SSL-enabled processes are restarted after the update\nis applied.\n\nThanks go to the OpenSSL team for providing patches for this issue.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains\nthe desired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
