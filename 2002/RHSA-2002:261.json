The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-1158 to this issue.\n\nIn addition, it was discovered that request validation was lacking in Canna\nserver versions 3.6 and earlier. A malicious remote user could exploit this\nvulnerability to leak information or cause a denial of service attack. \n(CAN-2002-1159)\n\nRed Hat Linux Advanced Server ships with a Canna package vulnerable\nto these issues; however, the package is normally only installed when\nJapanese language support is selected during installation.\n\nAll users of Canna are advised to upgrade to these errata packages which\ncontain a backported security fix and are not vulnerable to this issue.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank hsj and AIDA Shinra for the responsible\ndisclosure of these issues.\n    ",
