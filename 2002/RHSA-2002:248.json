				"text": "\nThe Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and\nfreely-available Web server.  PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language\ncommonly used with the Apache HTTP server.\n\nBuffer overflows in the ApacheBench support program (ab.c) in Apache\nversions prior to 1.3.27, allow a malicious Web server to cause a denial of\nservice and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long response.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0843 to this issue.\n\nTwo cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are present in the error pages\nfor the default \"404 Not Found\" error, and for the error response when a\nplain HTTP request is received on an SSL port.  Both of these issues are\nonly exploitable if the \"UseCanonicalName\" setting has been changed to\n\"Off\", and wildcard DNS is in use, and would allow remote attackers\nto execute scripts as other Web page visitors, for instance, to steal\ncookies.  These issues affect Apache versions 1.3 to 1.3.26,\nand mod_ssl versions before 2.8.12.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the names CAN-2002-0840 and\nCAN-2002-1157 to these issues.\n\nThe shared memory scoreboard in the HTTP daemon for Apache 1.3.x, prior to\nversion 1.3.27, allowed a user running as the web server user to send a\nSIGUSR1 signal to any process as root, resulting in a denial of service\n(process kill) or other such behavior that would not normally be allowed. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-839 to this issue.\n\nThe mail function in PHP 4.x to 4.2.2 may allow local script authors to\nbypass safe mode restrictions and modify command line arguments to the\nMTA (such as Sendmail) in the fifth argument to mail(), altering MTA\nbehavior and possibly executing arbitrary local commands. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name CAN-2002-0985\nto this issue.\n\nThe mail function in PHP 4.x to 4.2.2 does not filter ASCII control\ncharacters from its arguments, which could allow remote attackers to\nmodify mail message content, including mail headers, and possibly use\nPHP as a \"spam proxy\". The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0986 to this issue.\n\nStronghold 4 contains Apache 1.3.22, mod_ssl 2.8.7, and PHP 4.1.2, and\nis therefore vulnerable to these issues. Users of Stronghold are advised to\npatch or upgrade their servers.\n    ",
