These vulnerabilities can\ncause denial of service attacks as well as arbitrary code execution. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe names CAN-2001-0784, CAN-2001-1083, CAN-2001-1229, and CAN-2001-1230 to\nthese issues.\n\nUsers of Icecast are advised to update to the errata packages containing\nIcecast 1.3.12 which is not vulnerable to these issues.\n    ",
