Two bugs\nhave been found in the header parsing code in versions of Fetchmail prior\nto 6.1.0.  \n\nThe first bug allows a remote attacker to crash Fetchmail by sending a\ncarefully crafted DNS packet.  The second bug allows a remote attacker to\ncarefully craft an email in such a way that when it is parsed by Fetchmail\na heap overflow occurs, allowing remote arbitrary code execution.\n\nBoth of these bugs are only exploitable if Fetchmail is being used in\nmultidrop mode (using the \"multiple-local-recipients\" feature).\n\nAll users of Fetchmail are advised to upgrade to the errata packages\ncontaining a backported fix which is not vulnerable to these issues.\n    ",
