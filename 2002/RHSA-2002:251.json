				"text": "\nThe Apache HTTP server is a powerful, full-featured, efficient, and\nfreely-available Web server.\n\nBuffer overflows in the ApacheBench support program (ab.c) in Apache\nversions prior to 1.3.27 allow a malicious Web server to cause a denial of\nservice and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long response.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0843 to this issue.\n\nTwo cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are present in the error pages\nfor the default \"404 Not Found\" error, and for the error response when a\nplain HTTP request is received on an SSL port. Both of these issues are\nonly exploitable if the \"UseCanonicalName\" setting has been changed to\n\"Off\", and wildcard DNS is in use.  These issues would allow remote\nattackers to execute scripts as other Web page visitors, for instance, to\nsteal cookies. These issues affect versions of Apache 1.3 before 1.3.26,\nand versions of mod_ssl before 2.8.12. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the names CAN-2002-0840 and CAN-2002-1157 to\nthese issues.\n\nThe shared memory scoreboard in the HTTP daemon for Apache 1.3, prior to\nversion 1.3.27, allowed a user running as the \"apache\" UID to send a\nSIGUSR1 signal to any process as root, resulting in a denial of service\n(process kill) or other such behavior that would not normally be allowed. \nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2002-0839 to this issue. \n\nAll users of the Apache HTTP server are advised to upgrade to the\napplicable errata packages.  For Red Hat Linux Advanced Server 2.1 these\npackages include Apache version 1.3.27 which is not vulnerable to\nthese issues.\n\nNote that the instructions in the \"Solution\" section of this errata contain\nadditional steps required to complete the upgrade process.\n    ",
