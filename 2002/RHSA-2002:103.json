On some platforms this can be remotely\nexploited -- allowing arbitrary code to be run on the server.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0392 to this issue.\n\nWe have backported the security fix from the official Apache 1.3.26\nrelease. This should help minimize the impact of upgrading to our errata\npackages.\n\nAll users of Apache should update to these errata packages to correct this\nsecurity issue.\n\n[Update Jun 26 2002]\nUpdated packages have been added for Red Hat Linux for S/390.  Slight\nchanges to problem description to take into account possibility of exploits\nalso on 32-bit platforms.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
