				"text": "\nUW imapd is an IMAP daemon from the University of Washington.  Version\n2000c and previous versions have a bug that allows a malicious user to\nconstruct a malformed request which overflows an internal buffer, enabling\nthat user to execute commands on the server with the user's UID/GID. \n\nTo exploit this problem the user has to have successfully authenticated to\nthe imapd service.  Therefore, this vulnerability mainly affects free email\nproviders or mail servers where the user has no shell access to the system.\nOn other systems, in which the user already has shell access, users can\nalready run commands under their own UIDs/GIDs.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0379 to this issue.\n\nUsers of imapd are advised to upgrade to these errata packages containing\nversion 2001a of imapd. They are not vulnerable to this issue.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
