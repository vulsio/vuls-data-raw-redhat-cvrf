				"text": "\nMySQL is a multi-user, multi-threaded SQL database server. While auditing\nMySQL, Stefan Esser found security vulnerabilities that can be used to\ncrash the server or allow MySQL users to gain privileges.\n\nA signed integer vulnerability in the COM_TABLE_DUMP package for MySQL\n3.x to 3.23.53a  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n(crash or hang) in mysqld by causing large negative integers to be provided\nto a memcpy call.  (CAN-2002-1373)\n\nThe COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x to\n4.0.5a allows a remote attacker to gain privileges via a brute force\nattack using a one-character password, which causes MySQL to only compare\nthe provided password against the first character of the real\npassword. (CAN-2002-1374)\n\nThe COM_CHANGE_USER command in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x to\n4.0.5a allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long\nresponse.  (CAN-2002-1375)\n\nThe MySQL client library (libmysqlclient) in MySQL 3.x to 3.23.53a and 4.x\nto 4.0.5a does not properly verify length fields for certain responses\nin the read_rows or read_one_row routines, which allows a malicious server\nto cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary\ncode.  (CAN-2002-1376)\n\nRed Hat Linux 7, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0 contain versions of MySQL that\nare vulnerable to these issues. All users of MySQL are advised to upgrade\nto the erratum packages containing MySQL 3.23.54a which is not vulnerable\nto these issues.\n    ",
