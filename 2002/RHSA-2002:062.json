If an untrusted document uses a full pathname as an\nidentifier, it can cause that file to be written to -- as long as the\nuser performing the conversion has write access.\n\nUpdated docbook-utils packages are available that disable this\nfeature and enable filenames to be generated based on the type\nof the element rather than its identifier.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0169 to this issue.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
