Guardent discovered vulnerabilities which\naffect versions of wordtrans up to and including 1.1pre8.\n\nImproper input validation allows for the execution of arbitrary code or\ninjection of cross-site scripting code by passing in unexpected parameters\nto the wordtrans.php script. The wordtrans.php script then unsafely\nexecutes the wordtrans binary with the malformed parameters.\n\nAll users of wordtrans are advised to upgrade to the errata packages which\ncontain a patch to correct this vulnerability.\n\nThanks to Guardent, Inc. for the discovery, patch, and handling of this issue.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
