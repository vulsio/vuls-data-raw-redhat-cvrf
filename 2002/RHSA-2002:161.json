It has not \nbeen verified if this issue could lead to further consequences such as \nremote code execution.\n\nThese errata packages contain a patch to correct this vulnerability. \nPlease note that the original patch from the OpenSSL team had a mistake in\nit which could possibly still allow buffer overflows to occur.  This bug \nis also fixed in these errata packages.\n\nNOTE:\n\nPlease read the Solution section below as it contains instructions for\nmaking sure that all SSL-enabled processes are restarted after the update\nis applied.\n\nThanks go to the OpenSSL team for providing patches for these issues.\n    ",
