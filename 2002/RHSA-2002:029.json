These were:\n\n- a memory leak in the SNMP code\n- a crash on specially-formatted data in FTP URL parsing\n- HTCP would still be active, even if it was disabled in the config file\n\nThese errata pacakges contain Squid version 2.4.STABLE3, which is not\nvulnerable to these issues.  It is recommended that all users of Squid\nupdate to the fixed packages. \n\nNote: SNMP support is disabled in the\ndefault configuration of these packages (it was previously enabled).\nIf you need SNMP support, edit your squid configuration and change\nthe 'snmp_port' option; the default port for SNMP enabled-squid is\n3401.\n\nThanks go to Jouko Pynnonen for notifying us of the FTP vulnerability and\nto the Squid team for providing patches.\n\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2002-0067, CAN-2002-0068, CAN-2002-0069 to these issues.\n    ",
