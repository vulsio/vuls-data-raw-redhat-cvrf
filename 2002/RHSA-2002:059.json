Analog then performs an analysis on all\nstrings in the logfile and reports it. An attacker can exploit this\nvulnerability, for example, by introducing arbitrary Javascript code into\nan analog report produced by one user and read by a third person. \n \nAdditionally a problem was discovered in the optional CGI front end form\ninterface to analog, anlgform.pl in versions prior to 5.23.  An attacker\nwho has access to this program could cause the web server error log to fill.\n\nAll users of analog are advised to upgrade to the errata packages\ncontaining analog version 5.24 which is not affected by these vulnerabilities.\n    ",
