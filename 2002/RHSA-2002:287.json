An eavesdropper could exploit this\nvulnerability by replaying the response, thereby gaining authentication.\n\nAll users of VNC are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which\ncontain an updated version and are not vulnerable to this issue. \n\nNote that when using VNC on an untrusted network, always make sure to\ntunnel the VNC protocol through a secure, authenticated channel such as\nSSH.  Instructions on how to tunnel VNC through SSH are provided at the\nfollowing URL: http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/sshvnc.html\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
