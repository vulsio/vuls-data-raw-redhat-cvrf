				"text": "\nEthereal is a package designed for monitoring network traffic on your\nsystem.  Several security issues have been found in Ethereal:\n\nDue to improper string and error handling in Ethereal's ASN.1 parser, it is\npossible for a malformed SNMP or LDAP packet to cause a memory allocation\nor buffer overrun error in Ethereal versions before 0.9.2 (CAN-2002-0013\nCAN-2002-0012)\n\nThe ASN.1 parser in Ethereal 0.9.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (crash) via a certain malformed packet, which\ncauses Ethereal to allocate memory incorrectly, possibly due to zero-length\nfields. (CAN-2002-0353)\n\nThe SMB dissector in Ethereal prior to version 0.9.2 allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code\nvia malformed packets that cause Ethereal to dereference a NULL pointer.\n(CAN-2002-0401)\n\nA buffer overflow in X11 dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows\nremote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly\nexecute arbitrary code while Ethereal is parsing keysyms. (CAN-2002-0402)\n\nThe DNS dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows remote attackers to\ncause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed packet\nthat causes Ethereal to enter an infinite loop. (CAN-2002-0403)\n\nA vulnerability in GIOP dissector in Ethereal before 0.9.3 allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). (CAN-2002-0404)\n\nUsers of Ethereal should update to the errata packages containing Ethereal\nversion 0.9.4 which is not vulnerable to these issues.\n    ",
