This problem was discovered by\nSilvio Cesare.  CAN-2002-1355\n\nEthereal 0.9.7 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial\nof service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via malformed\npackets to the LMP, PPP, or TDS dissectors.  CAN-2002-1356\n\nUsers of Ethereal should update to the erratum packages containing Ethereal\nversion 0.9.8 which is not vulnerable to these issues.\n    ",
