This behavior could\nallow local users to gain root privileges by writing a Trojan horse library\nand getting the root user to run mkpasswd.\n\nThe tcl/tk package searched for its libraries in the current working\ndirectory before other directories, which could allow local users to\nexecute arbitrary code by writing Trojan horse library that is under a\nuser-controlled directory.\n\nThese issues affect Red Hat Linux versions 7 and 7.1, they were fixed\nin later Red Hat releases.\n\nAll users should upgrade to the errata packages which are not vulnerable to\nthese issues.\n    ",
