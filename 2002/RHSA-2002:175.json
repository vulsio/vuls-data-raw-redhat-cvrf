These updates fix a potential buffer overflow which can occur\nwhen nss_ldap is set to configure itself using information stored in DNS,\na format string bug in logging functions used in pam_ldap, and to properly\nhandle truncated DNS responses.\n    ",

				"text": "\nnss_ldap is a set of C library extensions that allow X.500 and LDAP\ndirectory servers to be used as a primary source of aliases, ethers,\ngroups, hosts, networks, protocols, users, RPCs, services, and shadow\npasswords (instead of or in addition to using flat files or NIS).\n\nWhen versions of nss_ldap prior to nss_ldap-198 are configured without a\nvalue for the \"host\" setting, nss_ldap will attempt to configure itself by\nusing SRV records stored in DNS.  When parsing the results of the DNS\nquery, nss_ldap does not check that the data returned by the server will\nfit into an internal buffer, leaving it vulnerable to a buffer overflow.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2002-0825 to this issue.\n\nWhen versions of nss_ldap prior to nss_ldap-199 are configured without a\nvalue for the \"host\" setting, nss_ldap will attempt to configure itself by\nusing SRV records stored in DNS.  When parsing the results of the DNS\nquery, nss_ldap does not check that the data returned has not been\ntruncated by the resolver libraries to avoid a buffer overflow, and may\nattempt to parse more data than is actually available, leaving it\nvulnerable to a read buffer overflow.  \n\nVersions of pam_ldap prior to version 144 include a format string bug in\nthe logging function. The packages included in this erratum update pam_ldap\nto version 144, fixing this bug.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2002-0374 to this issue.\n\nAll users of nss_ldap should update to these errata packages which are not\nvulnerable to the above issues. The errata packages are based on\nnss_ldap-189 with the addition of a backported security patch and pam_ldap\nversion 144.\n\nThanks to the nss_ldap and pam_ldap team at padl.com for providing\ninformation about these issues.\n    ",
