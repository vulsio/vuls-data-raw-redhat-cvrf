It includes various bug fixes, which are listed in\nthe README file included with the patch files.\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nA flaw was discovered in the way applications using Groovy used the\nstandard Java serialization mechanism. A remote attacker could use a\nspecially crafted serialized object that would execute code directly when\ndeserialized. All applications which rely on serialization and do not\nisolate the code which deserializes objects are subject to this\nvulnerability. (CVE-2015-3253)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.2.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\n    ",
