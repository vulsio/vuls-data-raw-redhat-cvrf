Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs \nrequired to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine \ninstances and controlling access through users and projects.\n\nAn information-exposure flaw was found in the OpenStack Compute (nova)\nresize and migrate functionality. An authenticated user could write a\nmalicious qcow header to an ephemeral or root disk, referencing a block\ndevice as a backing file. With a subsequent resize or migration, file\nsystem content on the specified device would be leaked to the user. Only\nsetups using libvirt with raw storage and \"use_cow_images = False\" were\naffected. (CVE-2016-2140)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Matthew Booth of Red Hat.\n\nAll openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich correct this issue.\n    ",
