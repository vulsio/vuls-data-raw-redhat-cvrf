The service provides the\nability to copy or snapshot a server image, and immediately store it away. \nStored images can be used as a template to get new servers up and running \nquickly and more consistently than installing a server operating system\nand individually configuring additional services.\n\nAn authorization vulnerability in OpenStack Image service was discovered,\nwhich allowed image-status manipulation using locations. By removing the\nlast location of an image, an authenticated user could change the status\nfrom 'active' to 'queue'. A malicious tenant could exploit this flaw to \nsilently replace owned image data, regardless of its original creator or \nvisibility settings. Only environments with show_multiple_locations set\nto true (not default) were affected. (CVE-2016-0757)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank OpenStack project for reporting this issue.\nUpstream acknowledges Erno Kuvaja of HPE as the original reporter.\n\nAll openstack-glance users are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which address this vulnerability.\n    ",
