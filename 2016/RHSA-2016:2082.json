				"text": "\nRed Hat Storage Console is a new Red Hat offering for storage administrators that provides a graphical management platform for Red Hat Ceph Storage 2. Red Hat Storage Console allows users to install, monitor, and manage a Red Hat Ceph Storage cluster.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A flaw was found in the way authentication details were passed between rhscon-ceph and rhscon-core. An authenticated, local attacker could use this flaw to recover the cleartext password. (CVE-2016-7062)\n\nBug Fix(es):\n\n* Previously, the PG was calculated on per pool basis instead of cluster level. With this fix, automatic calculation of PGs is disabled and the Ceph PG calculator is used to calculate the PG values per OSD to keep the cluster in healthy state. (BZ#1366577, BZ#1375538)\n\n* Issuing a command to compact its data store during a rolling upgrade renders the Ceph monitors unresponsive. To avoid this behavior, skip the command to compact the data store during a rolling upgrade. As a result, the Ceph monitors are responsive.(BZ#1372481)\n\n* Rolling upgrade fails when a custom cluster name other than 'ceph' is used and causes the ceph-ansible play to abort. With this fix, include the flags to indicate the cluster name, defaulting to 'ceph' when unspecified and the Ansible playbook succeeds with custom cluster names.(BZ#1373919)\n\n* Previously, pools list in Console displayed incorrect storage utilization and capacity data due to multiple CRUSH hierarchies. With this fix, the pools list in Console displays the correct storage utilization and capacity data.(BZ#1358267)\n\n* Previously, the CPU utilization chart displayed only the user processes CPU utilization and omitted system CPU utilization. With this fix, the CPU utilization chart displays the combined user and system CPU utilization percentage.(BZ#1358461)\n\n* A full-duplex channel is available for communication in both directions simultaneously and hence the effective bandwidth is twice the actual bandwidth. With this update, this has been modified, and the network utilization is now calculated properly.(BZ#1366242)\n\n* In the Host list page, incorrect chart data was displayed in utilization charts. With this fix, the chart displays correct data. (BZ#1358270)\n\n* Previously, Calamari failed to reflect the correct values for OSD status. With this update, the issue has been fixed and the dashboard displays the correct, real time OSD status.(BZ#1359129)\n\n* Previously, the text on the Add Storage tab was confusing due to unclear description regarding the storage type. With this fix, the text has been updated and a short description about the pools and RBDs is provided to ensure there is no ambiguity.(BZ#1365983)\n\n* Previously, while importing a cluster with collocated journals, the journal size used to incorrectly populate in the MongoDB database. With this fix, the journal size and the journal path is displayed correctly in the OSD summary of the Host OSDs tab.(BZ#1365998)\n\n* Previously, the clusters list in the console incorrectly depicted IOPS in units. With this fix, all the IOPS units are removed to correctly show the IOPS in the numeric count.(BZ#1366048)\n\n* While checking the cluster system performance, the selection of any elapsed hour range inappropriately displayed tick marks on both the elapsed hour(s) range. With this fix, the console displays system performance graph with a tick mark only on the selected elapsed hour(s).(BZ#1366081)\n\n* The journal device details did not synchronize as expected during pool creation and importing cluster workflows. This behavior is now fixed to fetch the actual device details for OSD journals and displays as expected in the UI.(BZ#1342969)\n\nAll users of Red Hat Storage Console are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which fix these bugs and add this enhancement.\n    ",
