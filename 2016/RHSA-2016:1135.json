				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Data Virtualization is a lean data integration solution that\nprovides easy, real-time, and unified data access across disparate sources\nto multiple applications and users. JBoss Data Virtualization makes data\nspread across physically distinct systems - such as multiple databases, XML\nfiles, and even Hadoop systems - appear as a set of tables in a local\ndatabase.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* A deserialization flaw allowing remote code execution was found in the BeanShell library. If BeanShell was on the classpath, it could permit code execution if another part of the application deserialized objects involving a specially constructed chain of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using the BeanShell library. (CVE-2016-2510)\n\n* A denial of service flaw was found in the way the HSLFSlideShow class implementation in Apache POI handled certain PPT files. A remote attacker could submit a specially crafted PPT file that would cause Apache POI to hang indefinitely. (CVE-2014-9527)\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Data Virtualization 6.2.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\n    ",
