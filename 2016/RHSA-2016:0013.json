Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs \nrequired to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine \ninstances and controlling access through users and projects.\n\nA vulnerability was discovered in the way OpenStack Compute (nova)\nnetworking handled security group updates; changes were not applied to\nalready running VM instances. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\naccess running VM instances. (CVE-2015-7713)\n\nAdditional bug fixes include:\n\n* Suspending an instance with a pre-created port that uses\n  binding:vnic_type='direct' previously failed; this has been fixed\n  with an update to the API.(BZ#1196054)\n\n* When using multipath-backed volumes using Object Storage (cinder), \n  attach attempts failed without error. The handling of device \n  identifiers has been updated and volumes can now be attached. \n  (BZ#1206699)\n\n* Previously, OpenStack Compute did not conform to PEP8  conventions;\n  this has been fixed. (BZ#1278411)\n\n* With a faulty lun in a multipath device, Compute tried to use the \n  wrong device. Compute now uses the correct device, and instances\n  can boot normally. (BZ#1280359)\n\n* When using a FCoE adapter instead of a FC adapter, volumes \n  previously failed to attach to the VM. This issue has been fixed. \n  (BZ#1284033) \n\nAll openstack-nova users are advised to upgrade to these updated \npackages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements.\n    ",
