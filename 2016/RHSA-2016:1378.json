It leverages common technologies such as PXE boot and IPMI to cover a wide range of hardware. It also supports pluggable drivers to allow added, vendor-specific functionality.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* An authentication vulnerability was found in openstack-ironic. A client with network access to the ironic-api service could bypass OpenStack Identity authentication, and retrieve all information about any node registered with OpenStack Bare Metal. If an unprivileged attacker knew (or was able to guess) the MAC address of a network card belonging to a node, the flaw could be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the node's /v1/drivers/$DRIVER_NAME/vendor_passthru resource. The response included the node's full details, including management passwords, even if the /etc/ironic/policy.json file was configured to hide passwords in API responses. (CVE-2016-4985)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Ironic project for reporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Devananda van der Veen (IBM) as the original reporter.\n    ",
