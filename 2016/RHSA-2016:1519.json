A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.\n\n[Updated August 25, 2016]\nThis advisory described the CVE-2016-3737 flaw in a way which implied\nthe issue was addressed via a code fix included in this erratum. However, the issue was actually addressed by updating the JON installation guide\nto document configuration changes that need to be applied manually to\nmitigate the issue. Refer to the Solution text below, and the Knowledgebase Article in the References section for further details.\n    ",

				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Operations Network is a Middleware management solution that provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.\n\nThis JBoss Operations Network 3.3.6 release serves as a replacement for JBoss Operations Network 3.3.5, and includes several bug fixes. Refer to the Customer Portal page linked in the References section for information on the most significant of these changes.\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was discovered that sending specially crafted HTTP request to the JON server would allow deserialization of that message without authentication. An attacker could use this flaw to cause remote code execution. (CVE-2016-3737)\n\nIt was discovered that sending requests containing large headers to the Web Console produced a Java OutOfMemoryError in the HTTP management interface. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2015-5220)\n\nA padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version 2.0 (SSLv2) protocol. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to decrypt RSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer SSL/TLS protocol version, allowing them to decrypt such connections. This cross-protocol attack is publicly referred to as DROWN. (CVE-2016-0800)\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.3.5, as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal, are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.3.6.\n    ",
