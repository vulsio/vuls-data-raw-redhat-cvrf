				"text": "\nThe rhev-hypervisor package provides a Red Hat Enterprise \nVirtualization Hypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise \nVirtualization Hypervisor is a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine \n(KVM) hypervisor. It includes everything necessary to run and manage \nvirtual machines: a subset of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating \nenvironment and the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available \nfor the Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization \nextensions.\n\nA padding oracle flaw was found in the Secure Sockets Layer version \n2.0 (SSLv2) protocol. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to \ndecrypt RSA-encrypted cipher text from a connection using a newer \nSSL/TLS protocol version, allowing them to decrypt such connections. \nThis cross-protocol attack is publicly referred to as DROWN. \n(CVE-2016-0800)\n\nNote: This issue was addressed by disabling the SSLv2 protocol by \ndefault when using the 'SSLv23' connection methods, and removing \nsupport for weak SSLv2 cipher suites. For more information, refer to \nthe knowledge base article linked in the References section.\n\nA flaw was found in the way malicious SSLv2 clients could negotiate \nSSLv2 ciphers that have been disabled on the server. This could \nresult in weak SSLv2 ciphers being used for SSLv2 connections, \nmaking them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2015-3197)\n\nA side-channel attack was found that makes use of cache-bank \nconflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker \nwho has the ability to control code in a thread running on the same \nhyper-threaded core as the victim's thread that is performing \ndecryption, could use this flaw to recover RSA private keys. \n(CVE-2016-0702)\n\nA double-free flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed certain \nmalformed DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) private keys. An \nattacker could create specially crafted DSA private keys that, when \nprocessed by an application compiled against OpenSSL, could cause \nthe application to crash. (CVE-2016-0705)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a NULL pointer dereference or a\nheap-based memory corruption, was found in the way some BIGNUM \nfunctions of OpenSSL were implemented. Applications that use these \nfunctions with large untrusted input could crash or, potentially, \nexecute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-0797)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenSSL project for reporting these \nissues. Upstream acknowledges Nimrod Aviram and Sebastian Schinzel\nas the original reporters of CVE-2016-0800 and CVE-2015-3197; Yuval\nYarom (University of Adelaide and NICTA), Daniel Genkin (Technion\nand Tel Aviv University), Nadia Heninger (University of Pennsylvania)\nas the original reporters of CVE-2016-0702; Adam Langley (Google/\nBoringSSL) as the original reporter of CVE-2016-0705; and Guido\nVranken as the original reporter of CVE-2016-0797.\n\nAll openssl users are advised to upgrade to this updated package,\nwhich contain backported patches to correct these issues. For the \nupdate to take effect, all services linked to the OpenSSL library \nmust be restarted, or the system rebooted.\n\nChanges to the rhev-hypervisor component:\n\n* Previously, a race between services during boot prevented network \nconfiguration from upgrading correctly. The risk for the race has \nnow been reduced significantly to allow the upgrade of the network \nconfiguration to complete correctly. (BZ#1194068)\n\n* Previously, using the text user interface (TUI) to log in to the \nadministrator account of Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization \nHypervisor failed with a Python backtrace. This update makes the \n\"six\" module correctly importable under all circumstances, which \nensures that logging in to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization \nHypervisor using TUI proceeds as expected. (BZ#1246836)\n    ",
