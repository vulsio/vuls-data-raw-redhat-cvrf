A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5387)\n\n* It was discovered that tomcat used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request. (CVE-2016-5388)\n\nNote: After this update, httpd will no longer pass the value of the Proxy request header to scripts via the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Scott Geary (VendHQ) for reporting this issue.\n    ",
