				"text": "\nThe kernel-rt packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* an array index error was found in the gdth driver in the Linux kernel. A\nlocal user could send a specially-crafted IOCTL request that would cause a\ndenial of service or, possibly, privilege escalation. (CVE-2009-3080,\nImportant)\n\n* a flaw was found in the FUSE implementation in the Linux kernel. When a\nsystem is low on memory, fuse_put_request() could dereference an invalid\npointer, possibly leading to a local denial of service or privilege\nescalation. (CVE-2009-4021, Important)\n\n* a flaw was found in each of the following Intel PRO/1000 Linux drivers in\nthe Linux kernel: e1000 and e1000e. A remote attacker using packets larger\nthan the MTU could bypass the existing fragment check, resulting in\npartial, invalid frames being passed to the network stack. These flaws\ncould also possibly be used to trigger a remote denial of service.\n(CVE-2009-4536, CVE-2009-4538, Important)\n\n* a flaw was found in the Realtek r8169 Ethernet driver in the Linux\nkernel. Receiving overly-long frames with a certain revision of the network\ncards supported by this driver could possibly result in a remote denial of\nservice. (CVE-2009-4537, Important)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* the \"function tracer\" from ftrace could eventually present problems when\na module was unloaded during a tracing session. Some of the related call\nsite entries for that module were not removed from ftrace's internal lists\nand could lead to confusing \"oops\" error messages. The call site entries\nare now removed correctly, and the errors no longer occur. (BZ#537472)\n\n* when using the kernel in tickless (or NOHZ) mode, time was not\naccumulated one tick at a time. This created latencies when the accumulated\ninterval grew large. Time is now accumulated logarithmically and latencies\nrelated to tickless mode no longer occur. (BZ#538370)\n\n* running the \"cset set\" command was resulting in unsafe access to a\nstructure that could be concurrently changed. This was eventually causing\nthe kernel to crash. The operations were repositioned so that they no\nlonger add locks, to minimize performance penalties. (BZ#541080)\n\n* the function used to calculate system load called different functions to\ncount the tasks in running and interpretable states. On systems with a\nlarge number of CPUs, this could result in several TLB and cache misses.\nThese functions have now been combined, and the problem has been\nsignificantly reduced. (BZ#552860)\n\n* when legacy PCI bus checks occurred, an off-by-one error would present.\nScanning 255 PCI buses is now allowed as 0xff is a valid bus, and the error\nno longer occurs. (BZ#552874)\n\n* on systems with 8 or more CPUs, an unnecessary anon_vma lock acquisition\nin vma_adjust() was causing a decrease in throughput. Code from the\nupstream kernel was backported, and the throughput decrease no longer\nexists. (BZ#552876)\n\n* the scheduler function double_lock_balance() favors logically lower CPUs.\nThis could cause logically higher CPUs to be starved if run queues were\nunder a lot of pressure, resulting in latencies. The algorithm has been\nadjusted so that it is fairer, and logically higher CPUs no longer risk\nbeing starved. (BZ#552877)\n\nThese updated packages also include other bug fixes. Users are directed to\nthe Red Hat Enterprise MRG 1.2 Release Notes for information on those\nfixes, available shortly from:\n\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_MRG/\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
