				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n\n* a use-after-free flaw was found in the tcp_rcv_state_process() function\nin the Linux kernel TCP/IP protocol suite implementation. If a system using\nIPv6 had the IPV6_RECVPKTINFO option set on a listening socket, a remote\nattacker could send an IPv6 packet to that system, causing a kernel panic\n(denial of service). (CVE-2010-1188, Important)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* a memory leak occurred when reading files on an NFS file system that was\nmounted with the \"noac\" option, causing memory to slowly be consumed.\nUnmounting the file system did not free the memory. With this update, the\nmemory is correctly freed, which resolves this issue. (BZ#588221)\n\n* the RHSA-2009:0225 update fixed a bug where, in some cases, on systems\nwith the kdump service enabled, pressing Alt+SysRq+C to trigger a crash\nresulted in a system hang; therefore, the system did not restart and boot\nthe dump-capture kernel as expected; no vmcore file was logged; and the\nfollowing message was displayed on the console:\n\nBUG: warning at arch/[arch]/kernel/crash.c:[xxx]/nmi_shootdown_cpus() (Not\ntainted)\n\nThe RHSA-2009:0225 update resolved this issue by not calling printk()\nduring a crash. It was later discovered that this fix did not resolve the\nissue in all cases, since there was one condition where printk() was\nstill being called: at a warning condition inside the mdelay() call.\n\nThis update replaces mdelay() calls with udelay(), where such a warning\ncondition does not exist, which fully resolves this issue, allowing\nAlt+SysRq+C to work as expected. (BZ#588211)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
