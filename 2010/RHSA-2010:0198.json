				"text": "\nOpenLDAP is an open source suite of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access\nProtocol) applications and development tools.\n\nA flaw was found in the way OpenLDAP handled NUL characters in the\nCommonName field of X.509 certificates. An attacker able to get a\ncarefully-crafted certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority\ncould trick applications using OpenLDAP libraries into accepting it by\nmistake, allowing the attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.\n(CVE-2009-3767)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* the ldap init script did not provide a way to alter system limits for the\nslapd daemon. A variable is now available in \"/etc/sysconfig/ldap\" for this\noption. (BZ#527313)\n\n* applications that use the OpenLDAP libraries to contact a Microsoft\nActive Directory server could crash when a large number of network\ninterfaces existed. This update implements locks in the OpenLDAP library\ncode to resolve this issue. (BZ#510522)\n\n* when slapd was configured to allow client certificates, approximately 90%\nof connections froze because of a large CA certificate file and slapd not\nchecking the success of the SSL handshake. (BZ#509230)\n\n* the OpenLDAP server would freeze for unknown reasons under high load.\nThese packages add support for accepting incoming connections by new\nthreads, resolving the issue. (BZ#507276)\n\n* the compat-openldap libraries did not list dependencies on other\nlibraries, causing programs that did not specifically specify the libraries\nto fail. Detection of the Application Binary Interface (ABI) in use on\n64-bit systems has been added with this update. (BZ#503734)\n\n* the OpenLDAP libraries caused applications to crash due to an unprocessed\nnetwork timeout. A timeval of -1 is now passed when NULL is passed to LDAP.\n(BZ#495701)\n\n* slapd could crash on a server under heavy load when using rwm overlay,\ncaused by freeing non-allocated memory during operation cleanup.\n(BZ#495628)\n\n* the ldap init script made a temporary script in \"/tmp/\" and attempted to\nexecute it. Problems arose when \"/tmp/\" was mounted with the noexec option.\nThe temporary script is no longer created. (BZ#483356)\n\n* the ldap init script always started slapd listening on ldap:/// even if\ninstructed to listen only on ldaps:///. By correcting the init script, a\nuser can now select which ports slapd should listen on. (BZ#481003)\n\n* the slapd manual page did not mention the supported options -V and -o.\n(BZ#468206)\n\n* slapd.conf had a commented-out option to load the syncprov.la module.\nOnce un-commented, slapd crashed at start-up because the module had already\nbeen statically linked to OpenLDAP. This update removes \"moduleload\nsyncprov.la\" from slapd.conf, which resolves this issue. (BZ#466937)\n\n* the migrate_automount.pl script produced output that was unsupported by\nautofs. This is corrected by updating the output LDIF format for automount\nrecords. (BZ#460331)\n\n* the ldap init script uses the TERM signal followed by the KILL signal\nwhen shutting down slapd. Minimal delay between the two signals could cause\nthe LDAP database to become corrupted if it had not finished saving its\nstate. A delay between the signals has been added via the \"STOP_DELAY\"\noption in \"/etc/sysconfig/ldap\". (BZ#452064)\n\n* the migrate_passwd.pl migration script had a problem when number fields\ncontained only a zero. Such fields were considered to be empty, leading to\nthe attribute not being set in the LDIF output. The condition in\ndump_shadow_attributes has been corrected to allow for the attributes to\ncontain only a zero. (BZ#113857)\n\n* the migrate_base.pl migration script did not handle third level domains\ncorrectly, creating a second level domain that could not be held by a\ndatabase with a three level base. This is now allowed by modifying the\nmigrate_base.pl script to generate only one domain. (BZ#104585)\n\nUsers of OpenLDAP should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.\n    ",
