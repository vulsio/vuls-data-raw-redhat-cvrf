				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the sctp_rcv_ootb() function\nin the Linux kernel Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)\nimplementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP\npacket to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.\n(CVE-2010-0008, Important)\n\n* a NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the ip6_dst_lookup_tail()\nfunction in the Linux kernel. An attacker on the local network could\ntrigger this flaw by sending IPv6 traffic to a target system, leading to a\nsystem crash (kernel OOPS) if dst->neighbour is NULL on the target system\nwhen receiving an IPv6 packet. (CVE-2010-0437, Important)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* programs compiled on x86, and that also call sched_rr_get_interval(),\nwere silently corrupted when run on 64-bit systems. With this update, when\nsuch programs attempt to call sched_rr_get_interval() on 64-bit systems,\nsys32_sched_rr_get_interval() is called instead, which resolves this issue.\n(BZ#557682)\n\n* the fix for CVE-2009-4538 provided by RHSA-2010:0079 introduced a\nregression, preventing Wake on LAN (WoL) working for network devices using\nthe Intel PRO/1000 Linux driver, e1000e. Attempting to configure WoL for\nsuch devices resulted in the following error, even when configuring valid\noptions:\n\n\"Cannot set new wake-on-lan settings: Operation not supported\nnot setting wol\"\n\nThis update resolves this regression, and WoL now works as expected for\nnetwork devices using the e1000e driver. (BZ#559333)\n\n* a number of bugs have been fixed in the copy_user routines for Intel 64\nand AMD64 systems, one of which could have possibly led to data corruption.\n(BZ#568305)\n\n* on some systems, a race condition in the inode-based file event\nnotifications implementation caused soft lockups and the following\nmessages:\n\n\"BUG: warning at fs/inotify.c:181/set_dentry_child_flags()\"\n\"BUG: soft lockup - CPU#[x] stuck for 10s!\"\n\nThis update resolves this race condition, and also removes the inotify\ndebugging code from the kernel, due to race conditions in that code.\n(BZ#568662)\n\n* if a program that calls posix_fadvise() were compiled on x86, and then\nrun on a 64-bit system, that program could experience various problems,\nincluding performance issues and the call to posix_fadvise() failing,\ncausing the program to not run as expected or even abort. With this update,\nwhen such programs attempt to call posix_fadvise() on 64-bit systems,\nsys32_fadvise64() is called instead, which resolves this issue. This update\nalso fixes other 32-bit system calls that were mistakenly called on 64-bit\nsystems (including systems running the kernel-xen kernel). (BZ#569595)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
