				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n\n* Buffer overflow flaws were found in the Linux kernel's implementation of\nthe server-side External Data Representation (XDR) for the Network File\nSystem (NFS) version 4. An attacker on the local network could send a\nspecially-crafted large compound request to the NFSv4 server, which could\npossibly result in a kernel panic (denial of service) or, potentially, code\nexecution. (CVE-2010-2521, Important)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* A race condition existed when generating new process IDs with the result\nthat the wrong process could have been signaled or killed accidentally,\nleading to various application faults. This update detects and disallows\nthe reuse of PID numbers. (BZ#638865)\n\n* In a two node cluster, moving 100 files between two folders using the\nlock master was nearly instantaneous. However, not using the lock master\nresulted in considerably worse performance on both GFS1 (Global File System\n1) and GFS2 (Global File System 2) file systems. With this update, not\nusing the lock master does not lead to worsened performance on either of\nthe aforementioned file systems. (BZ#639071)\n\n* The device naming changed after additional devices were added to the\nsystem and caused various problems. With this update, device naming remains\nconstant after adding any additional devices. (BZ#646764)\n\n* On some bnx2-based devices, frames could drop unexpectedly. This was\nshown by the increasing \"rx_fw_discards\" values in the \"ethtool\n--statistics\" output. With this update, frames are no longer dropped and\nall bnx2-based devices work as expected. (BZ#649254)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
