				"text": "\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally\nmanaging collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nand Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give\nadministrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Manager. Major changes in version 2.2 include an\nimport and export capability, and desktop support (VDI).\n\nIt was found that Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager did not\ncorrectly pass the postzero parameter for deleted volumes after snapshot\nmerging. This resulted in such volumes not being securely deleted as\nexpected. A guest user in a new, raw virtual machine (VM), created in a\ndata domain that has had VMs deleted from it, could use this flaw to read\nlimited data from those deleted VMs, potentially disclosing sensitive\ninformation. (CVE-2010-2224)\n\nThis update provides updated components that include fixes for security\nissues; however, these issues have no security impact for Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Manager. These fixes are for expat issues\nCVE-2009-3560 and CVE-2009-3720; libpng issues CVE-2007-5266,\nCVE-2007-5267, CVE-2007-5268, CVE-2007-5269, CVE-2008-1382, CVE-2008-5907,\nCVE-2008-6218, CVE-2009-0040, CVE-2009-2042, and CVE-2010-0205; and openssl\nissues CVE-2008-5077, CVE-2009-0590, CVE-2009-1377, CVE-2009-1378,\nCVE-2009-1379, CVE-2009-1386, CVE-2009-1387, CVE-2009-2409, CVE-2009-3555,\nCVE-2009-4355, and CVE-2010-0433.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs and adds several enhancements.\nDocumentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available from\nhttp://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/2.2/html/Servers-Manager_Security_Update\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users should install this\nupdated package, which corrects this issue, and fixes the bugs and adds the\nenhancements noted in the \"Manager Security Update\" document, linked to in\nthe References.\n    ",
