				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* When an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently\noverwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault\noccurring, which could cause an application to execute arbitrary code,\npossibly leading to privilege escalation. It is known that the X Window\nSystem server can be used to trigger this flaw. (CVE-2010-2240, Important)\n\n* A miscalculation of the size of the free space of the initial directory\nentry in a directory leaf block was found in the Linux kernel Global File\nSystem 2 (GFS2) implementation. A local, unprivileged user with write\naccess to a GFS2-mounted file system could perform a rename operation on\nthat file system to trigger a NULL pointer dereference, possibly resulting\nin a denial of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2010-2798, Important)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the X.Org security team for reporting\nCVE-2010-2240, with upstream acknowledging Rafal Wojtczuk as the original\nreporter; and Grant Diffey of CenITex for reporting CVE-2010-2798.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Problems receiving network traffic correctly via a non-standard layer 3\nprotocol when using the ixgbe driver. This update corrects this issue.\n(BZ#618275)\n\n* A bug was found in the way the megaraid_sas driver (for SAS based RAID\ncontrollers) handled physical disks and management IOCTLs. All physical\ndisks were exported to the disk layer, allowing an oops in\nmegasas_complete_cmd_dpc() when completing the IOCTL command if a timeout\noccurred. One possible trigger for this bug was running \"mkfs\". This update\nresolves this issue by updating the megaraid_sas driver to version 4.31.\n(BZ#619363)\n\n* Previously, Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) resulted in PCI bus writes\nto mask and unmask the MSI IRQ for a PCI device. These unnecessary PCI bus\nwrites resulted in the serialization of MSIs, leading to poor performance\non systems with high MSI load. This update adds a new kernel boot\nparameter, msi_nolock, which forgoes the PCI bus writes and allows for\nbetter simultaneous processing of MSIs. (BZ#621939)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
