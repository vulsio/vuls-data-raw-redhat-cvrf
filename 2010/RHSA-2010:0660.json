				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issues:\n\n* when an application has a stack overflow, the stack could silently\noverwrite another memory mapped area instead of a segmentation fault\noccurring, which could cause an application to execute arbitrary code,\npossibly leading to privilege escalation. It is known that the X Window\nSystem server can be used to trigger this flaw. (CVE-2010-2240, Important)\n\n* a miscalculation of the size of the free space of the initial directory\nentry in a directory leaf block was found in the Linux kernel Global File\nSystem 2 (GFS2) implementation. A local, unprivileged user with write\naccess to a GFS2-mounted file system could perform a rename operation on\nthat file system to trigger a NULL pointer dereference, possibly resulting\nin a denial of service or privilege escalation. (CVE-2010-2798, Important)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the X.Org security team for reporting\nCVE-2010-2240, with upstream acknowledging Rafal Wojtczuk as the original\nreporter; and Grant Diffey of CenITex for reporting CVE-2010-2798.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3 General Availability (GA) release\nintroduced a regression in iSCSI failover time. While there was heavy I/O\non the iSCSI layer, attempting to log out of an iSCSI connection at the\nsame time a network problem was occurring, such as a switch dying or a\ncable being pulled out, resulted in iSCSI failover taking several minutes.\nWith this update, failover occurs as expected. (BZ#583898)\n\n* a bug was found in the way the megaraid_sas driver (for SAS based RAID\ncontrollers) handled physical disks and management IOCTLs. All physical\ndisks were exported to the disk layer, allowing an oops in\nmegasas_complete_cmd_dpc() when completing the IOCTL command if a timeout\noccurred. One possible trigger for this bug was running \"mkfs\". This update\nresolves this issue by updating the megaraid_sas driver to version 4.31.\n(BZ#619362)\n\n* this update upgrades the bnx2x driver to version 1.52.1-6, and the bnx2x\nfirmware to version 1.52.1-6, incorporating multiple bug fixes and\nenhancements. These fixes include: A race condition on systems using the\nbnx2x driver due to multiqueue being used to transmit data, but only a\nsingle queue transmit ON/OFF scheme being used (only a single queue is\nused with this update); a bug that could have led to a kernel panic when\nusing iSCSI offload; and a bug that caused a firmware crash, causing\nnetwork devices using the bnx2x driver to lose network connectivity. When\nthis firmware crash occurred, errors such as \"timeout polling for state\"\nand \"Stop leading failed!\" were logged. A system reboot was required to\nrestore network connectivity. (BZ#620663, BZ#620668, BZ#620669, BZ#620665)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
