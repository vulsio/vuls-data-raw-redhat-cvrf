				"text": "\nRed Hat Gluster Storage is software only scale-out storage solution that provides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data storage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves availability and manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.\n\nThis advisory fixes the following bugs: \n\n* With this update, caching of SELinux extended attribute (security.selinux) from vfs_glusterfs module in samba is enabled as SELinux extended attribute is part of every file and directory when operating under 'Enforcing' mode and if you fail to include it in the metadata cache it causes an additional delay in listing the directory contents. This improves performance with listing the contents of larger directories. (BZ#1908339)\n\n* Previously, snapshots were not listed as 'Previous versions' in Windows explorer while trying to restore using the 'Properties' tab or 'right-click' menu for directories and entire volumes as shadow_copy2 VFS module in samba failed to open snapshot directories with the necessary flags. With this update, the flags which negate the notion of a read-only filesystem are filtered, thus preserving the required directory open flags. (BZ#1884292)\n\nUsers of samba with Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.\n    ",
