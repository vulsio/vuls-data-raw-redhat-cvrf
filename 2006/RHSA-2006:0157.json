The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the\nname CVE-2005-3745 to this issue. Please note that this issue does not\naffect Struts running on Tomcat or JOnAS, which is our supported usage of\nStruts.\n\nAll users of Red Hat Application Server should upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain Struts version 1.2.8 which is not vulnerable to\nthis issue.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
