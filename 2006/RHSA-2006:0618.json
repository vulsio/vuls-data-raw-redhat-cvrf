This could\nallow an attacker to perform a cross-site scripting attack if a victim was\ntricked into connecting to a site and sending a carefully crafted Expect\nheader. (CVE-2006-3918)\n\nWhile a web browser cannot be forced to send an arbitrary Expect header by\na third-party attacker, it was recently discovered that certain versions of\nthe Flash plugin can manipulate request headers. If users running such\nversions can be persuaded to load a web page with a malicious Flash applet,\na cross-site scripting attack against the server may be possible.\n\nUsers of Apache should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain a\nbackported patch to correct this issue.\n    ",
