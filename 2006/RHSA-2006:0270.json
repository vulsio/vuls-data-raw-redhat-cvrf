				"text": "\nRed Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server.\n\nFor the latest information, refer to the release notes at the\nfollowing URL:\n\n    http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/dir-server\n\nEvgeny Legerov discovered several flaws affecting Red Hat Directory Server\nusing the GLEG ProtoVer LDAP test suite.  A remote attacker who is able to\nconnect to the directory server could send malicious requests which would\ncause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2006-0451,\nCVE-2006-0452, CVE-2006-0453)\n\nThis update also addresses the following issues:\n\n* 173687 - When the Directory Server's effective user and the real user \n  are different, there was a small window that creates log files owned by\n  the real user, which should be owned by the effective user.\n\n* 175063 - When an ldif file contains an entry with the dn that includes\n  escaped double quotes, importing the entry could fail and the\n  entry is skipped. The following reindex fails due to the skip.\n\n* 175897 - There was a problem in evaluating the intersection of multiple\n  range searches when the attribute of each range search is different from\n  each other. \n\n  For example: \n\n    &(attr1 <= val1)(attr2 >= val2)  \n\n  This issue has been fixed.\n\n* 185477 - In previous 7.X versions of Red Hat Directory Server, importing\n  a malformed parent entry and some child entries resulted in the child\n  entries being successfully added without a parent.\n\n* 184585 - The server did not allow a re-bind using SASL on the same\n  connection, returning error 49.\n\n* 185765 - The password sync tool leaked memory.\n\n* 181827 - Deleting an attribute value by trimming it's value to an empty\n  string in Active Directory did not sync to Red Hat Directory Server. This\n  issue has been fixed. \n\n* 186657 - Sustained heavy password modification load on the Active\n  Directory side could potentially crash passsync.exe. This issue has been\n  fixed.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which resolves these\nissues.\n    ",
