			{
				"text": "\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language.  Several security issues were\nfound in the PHP package in Stronghold 4.0:\n\nThe wordwrap() PHP function did not properly check for integer overflow in\nthe way the \"break\" parameter was handled. An attacker who could control a\nstring passed to the \"break\" parameter could cause a heap overflow.\n(CVE-2006-1990)\n\nThe phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. This\ncould allow an attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks against\nsites that had publicly-available PHP scripts that called phpinfo().\n(CVE-2006-0996)\n\nThe error handling output was found to improperly escape HTML output in\ncertain cases. This could allow an attacker to perform cross-site\nscripting attacks against sites where both display_errors and html_errors\nwere enabled. (CVE-2006-0208) \n\nA flaw in the way PHP registered global variables during a file upload\nrequest was discovered. A remote attacker could submit a carefully crafted\nmultipart/form-data POST request that could overwrite the $GLOBALS array,\nwhich could alter expected script behavior and possibly lead to the\nexecution of arbitrary PHP commands. Note that this vulnerability only\naffects installations which have register_globals enabled in the PHP\nconfiguration file, which is neither a default nor recommended option.\n(CVE-2005-3390)\n\nA flaw in the PHP parse_str() function was discovered. If a PHP script\npassed only one argument to the parse_str() function, and the script was\nforced to abort execution during operation (for example, due to the\nmemory_limit setting), the register_globals may be enabled even if it was\ndisabled in the PHP configuration file. This vulnerability only affects\ninstallations that have PHP scripts using the parse_str function in this\nway. (CVE-2005-3389) \n\nA Cross-Site Scripting flaw in the phpinfo() function was discovered. If a\nvictim was tricked into following a malicious URL to a site with a page\ndisplaying the phpinfo() output, it was possible to inject javascript or\nHTML content into the displayed page or steal data such as cookies. This\nvulnerability only affects installations that allow users to view the\noutput of the phpinfo() function. As the phpinfo() function outputs a large\namount of information about the current state of PHP, it should only be\nused during debugging or if protected by authentication. (CVE-2005-3388) \n\nA buffer overflow flaw was discovered in uw-imap, the University of\nWashington's IMAP Server. php-imap is compiled against the static c-client\nlibraries from imap and therefore needed to be recompiled against the fixed\nversion. (CVE-2005-2933) \n\nA flaw was found in the zend_hash_del() PHP function. For PHP scripts that\nrely on the use of the unset() function, a remote attacker could force\nvariable initialization to be bypassed. This would be a security issue\nparticularly for installations that enable the \"register_globals\" setting.\n\"register_globals\" is disabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.\n(CVE-2006-3017)\n\nA directory traversal vulnerability was found in PHP. Local users could\nbypass open_basedir restrictions allowing remote attackers to create files\nin arbitrary directories via the tempnam() function. (CVE-2006-1494)\n\nUsers of Stronghold are advised to upgrade to this update, which\ncontains backported patches to correct these issues.\n    ",
