The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nassigned the name CVE-2006-0058 to this issue.\n\nBy default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, Sendmail is configured to only\naccept connections from the local host.  Therefore only users who have\nconfigured Sendmail to listen to remote hosts would be able to be remotely\nexploited by this vulnerability.\n\nIn order to correct this issue for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users, it\nwas necessary to upgrade the version of Sendmail from 8.11 as originally\nshipped to Sendmail 8.12 with the addition of the security patch supplied\nby Sendmail Inc.  This erratum provides updated packages based on Sendmail\n8.12 with a compatibility mode enabled.  After updating to these packages,\nusers should pay close attention to their sendmail logs to ensure that the\nupgrade completed sucessfully.\n    ",
