Two internal service APIs were incorrectly provisioned using a test certificate from the source repository which resulted in all installations using the same certificates. If an attacker could observe network traffic internal to a cluster, they could use the private key to decode API requests that should be protected by TLS sessions, and potentially obtaining information they would not otherwise be able to. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.",
