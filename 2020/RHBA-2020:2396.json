				"text": "\nThe ovirt-engine package provides the Red Hat Virtualization Manager, a\ncentralized management platform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual machines. The Manager provides a comprehensive range of features including search capabilities, resource management, live migrations, and virtual infrastructure provisioning.\n\nThe Manager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several interfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and interacted with, including an Administration Portal, a VM Portal, and a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API).\n\nPostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.  \n\nChanges to the ovirt-engine component:\n\n* Previously, a new DB was introduced as part of the cinderlib (managed block storage) support, but did not include a backup and restore option. The current release fixes this issue by providing a backup and restore option. (BZ#1820642)\n\n* Previously, the landing page for the RHV Manager did not support scrolling. As a result, with specific resolutions or zoom ratios, some areas of the landing page were not visible, including the link to the Administration Portal. The current release fixes this issue by enabling users to scroll the landing page and access any of the links on it. (BZ#1796136)\n\n* Previously, using the Administration Portal to import a storage domain omitted custom mount options for NFS storage servers. The current release fixes this issue by including the custom mount options. (BZ#1828067)\n\nChanges to the Documentation component:\n\n* The current release adds support for installing Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) version 4.4 on Red Hat Virtualization (RHV). The installer that deploys RHOCP on RHV automates the process using “installer-provisioned infrastructure.” This installer is available for Linux and macOS only. The resulting RHOCP cluster runs the master and worker nodes on virtual machines in RHV. (BZ#1764779)\n    ",
