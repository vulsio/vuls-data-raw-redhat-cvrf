				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Operations Network is a middleware management solution that\nprovides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor JBoss\nEnterprise Middleware, applications, and services.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the DiskFileItem class handled NULL characters\nin file names. A remote attacker able to supply a serialized instance of\nthe DiskFileItem class, which will be deserialized on a server, could use\nthis flaw to write arbitrary content to any location on the server that is\naccessible to the user running the application server process.\n(CVE-2013-2186)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of the\norg.jboss.remoting.transport.socket.ServerThread class in JBoss\nRemoting. An attacker could use this flaw to exhaust all available file\ndescriptors on the target server, preventing legitimate connections. Note\nthat to exploit this flaw remotely, the remoting port must be exposed\ndirectly or indirectly (for example, deploying a public facing application\nthat uses JBoss Remoting could indirectly expose this flaw).\n(CVE-2013-4210)\n\nIt was found that the JBoss Operations Network server exposed configured\npasswords in plain text in its log files by default. A local user with\naccess to these log files could use the exposed credentials.\n(CVE-2013-4293)\n\nA flaw was found in the way JPADriftServerBean instances stored drift\nfiles. The storeFiles method created a predictable temporary directory when\nunpacking a zip file. Once a zip file was extracted to the temporary\ndirectory, all files in this directory were stored. A local attacker could\nprovide their own drift files to be imported into the server instance.\n(CVE-2013-4373)\n\nThe CVE-2013-4293 was discovered by Larry O'Leary of the Red Hat Middleware\nSupport Engineering Group, and CVE-2013-4210 was discovered by James\nLivingston of the Red Hat Support Engineering Group.\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.1.2 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this update.\n    ",
