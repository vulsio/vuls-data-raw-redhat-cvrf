				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process\nautomation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss Portal is the open source\nimplementation of the Java EE suite of services and Portal services running\natop Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.\n\nXML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various\nframeworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use\ninsecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled\non endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as\nCVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be\nrecovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. This issue only affected the\nJBoss Web Services Native (jbossws-native) stack as Red Hat JBoss SOA\nPlatform 4 and Red Hat JBoss Portal 4 do not use JBoss Web Services CXF\n(jbossws-cxf). (CVE-2012-5575)\n\nFor jbossws-native, the fix for CVE-2012-5575 is implemented by two new\nconfiguration parameters in the 'encryption' element. This element can be a\nchild of 'requires' in both client and server wsse configuration\ndescriptors (set on a per-application basis via the application's\njboss-wsse-server.xml and jboss-wsse-client.xml files). The new attributes\nare 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms'. These attributes should contain a\nblank space or comma separated list of algorithm IDs that are allowed for\nthe encrypted incoming message, both for encryption and private key\nwrapping. For backwards compatibility, no algorithm checks are performed by\ndefault for empty lists or missing attributes.\n\nFor example (do not include the line break in your configuration):\n\nencryption algorithms=\"aes-192-gcm aes-256-gcm\"\nkeyWrapAlgorithms=\"rsa_oaep\"\n\nSpecifies that incoming messages are required to be encrypted, and that the\nonly permitted encryption algorithms are AES-192 and 256 in GCM mode, and\nRSA-OAEP only for key wrapping.\n\nBefore performing any decryption, the jbossws-native stack will verify that\neach algorithm specified in the incoming messages is included in the\nallowed algorithms lists from these new encryption element attributes. The\nalgorithm values to be used for 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms' are\nthe same as for 'algorithm' and 'keyWrapAlgorithm' in the 'encrypt'\nelement.\n\nAfter applying this update, an \"org.xml.sax.SAXParseException: DOCTYPE is\ndisallowed...\" error may occur when using transactions. To work around this\nissue, add -Dorg.jboss.ws.enable_doctype_decl=true to the application\nserver's run parameters.\n\nAlso, for users of Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4.3 CP05, after installing\nthis update, ensure any @BindingType annotations in your deployed\napplications are updated to be applied to the relevant service\nimplementations rather than the interfaces.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj\nSomorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss installation,\nincluding any databases, database settings, applications, configuration\nfiles, and so on.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 4.3 CP05 and Red Hat JBoss Portal\n4.3 CP07 as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply\nthis update.
