JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the\nopen source implementation of the Java EE suite of services and Portal\nservices running atop JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.\n\nAn attack technique was found against the W3C XML Encryption Standard when\nblock ciphers were used in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to conduct chosen-ciphertext attacks, leading\nto the recovery of the entire plain text of a particular cryptogram by\nexamining the differences between SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)\nresponses sent from JBoss Web Services. (CVE-2011-1096)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for\nreporting this issue.\n\nNote: Manual action is required to apply this update. The CVE-2011-1096\nissue is an attack on the WS-Security standard itself. Using new\nGalois/Counter Mode (GCM) based algorithms for WS-Security encryption is\nthe W3C suggested way of dealing with this issue. To use GCM algorithms in\nyour application, update the encrypt element of all jboss-ws-security\nconfiguration to specify a GCM algorithm. The following is an example\ndirective:\n\nencrypt type=\"x509v3\" algorithm=\"aes-128-gcm\" alias=\"wsse\"\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your JBoss installation,\nincluding any databases, database settings, applications, configuration\nfiles, and so on.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.3 CP05 and JBoss Enterprise\nPortal Platform 4.3 CP07 as provided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are\nadvised to apply this update.\n    ",
