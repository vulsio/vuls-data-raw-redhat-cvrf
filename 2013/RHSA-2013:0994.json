				"text": "\nThe openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation\nof the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,\nCatalog, and Policy services.\n\nA flaw was found in the way Keystone handled LDAP (Lightweight Directory\nAccess Protocol) based authentication. If Keystone was configured to use\nLDAP authentication, and the LDAP server was configured to allow anonymous\nbinds (anonymous binds is a common default), anyone able to connect to a\ngiven service using Keystone could connect as any user, including the\nadmin, without supplying a password. (CVE-2013-2157)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Thierry Carrez of OpenStack upstream for\nreporting this issue. Upstream acknowledges Jose Castro Leon of CERN as\nthe original reporter.\n\nThese updated packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2013.1.2,\nwhich provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version. (BZ#972660)\n\nAll users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted\nautomatically.\n    ",
