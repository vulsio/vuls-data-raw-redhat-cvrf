				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Portal 5.2.2 roll up patch 1, which fixes multiple security\nissues and various bugs, is now available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having\nimportant security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base\nscores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each\nvulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.\n    ",

				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Portal is the open source implementation of the Java EE suite\nof services and Portal services running atop Red Hat JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform.\n\nJBoss Web Services leaked side-channel data when distributing symmetric\nkeys (for XML encryption), allowing a remote attacker to recover the entire\nplain text form of a symmetric key. (CVE-2011-2487)\n\nSpring framework could possibly evaluate Expression Language (EL)\nexpressions twice, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in\nthe context of the application server, or to obtain sensitive information\nfrom the server. (CVE-2011-2730)\n\nNote: Manual action is required to apply the fix for CVE-2011-2730. If your\nsystem has deployed applications which use Spring framework, the context\nparameter \"springJspExpressionSupport\" must be set to \"false\" to mitigate\nCVE-2011-2730, for example, in the application's web.xml file. This will\nprevent the double-evaluation of EL expressions that leads to the flaw.\nRed Hat JBoss Portal will deploy an application using Spring framework if\nJOSSO (Java Open Single Sign-On) is configured.\n\nXML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various\nframeworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use\ninsecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled\non endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as\nCVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be\nrecovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. This issue only affected\nthe JBoss Web Services Native (jbossws-native) stack as Red Hat JBoss\nPortal does not use JBoss Web Services CXF (jbossws-cxf). (CVE-2012-5575)\n\nFor jbossws-native, the fix for CVE-2012-5575 is implemented by two new\nconfiguration parameters in the 'encryption' element. This element can be a\nchild of 'requires' in both client and server wsse configuration\ndescriptors (set on a per-application basis via the application's\njboss-wsse-server.xml and jboss-wsse-client.xml files). The new attributes\nare 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms'. These attributes should contain a\nblank space or comma separated list of algorithm IDs that are allowed for\nthe encrypted incoming message, both for encryption and private key\nwrapping. For backwards compatibility, no algorithm checks are performed by\ndefault for empty lists or missing attributes.\n\nFor example (do not include the line break in your configuration):\n\nencryption algorithms=\"aes-192-gcm aes-256-gcm\"\nkeyWrapAlgorithms=\"rsa_oaep\"\n\nSpecifies that incoming messages are required to be encrypted, and that the\nonly permitted encryption algorithms are AES-192 and 256 in GCM mode, and\nRSA-OAEP only for key wrapping.\n\nBefore performing any decryption, the jbossws-native stack will verify that\neach algorithm specified in the incoming messages is included in the\nallowed algorithms lists from these new encryption element attributes. The\nalgorithm values to be used for 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms' are\nthe same as for 'algorithm' and 'keyWrapAlgorithm' in the 'encrypt'\nelement.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum\nfor reporting CVE-2011-2487, and Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj\nSomorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting CVE-2012-5575.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on\nRed Hat JBoss Portal, along with all customized configuration files, and\nany databases and database settings.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Portal 5.2.2 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.\n    ",
