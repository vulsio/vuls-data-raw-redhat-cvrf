				"text": "\nThe Enterprise Web Platform is a slimmed down profile of the JBoss\nEnterprise Application Platform intended for mid-size workloads with light\nand rich Java applications.\n\nXML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various\nframeworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use\ninsecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled\non endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as\nCVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be\nrecovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. This issue affected both the\nJBoss Web Services CXF (jbossws-cxf) and JBoss Web Services Native\n(jbossws-native) stacks. (CVE-2012-5575)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Tibor Jager, Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj\nSomorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum for reporting this issue.\n\nIf you are using jbossws-cxf, then automatic checks to prevent this flaw\nare only run when WS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security\nrequirements. It is best practice to use WS-SecurityPolicy to enforce\nsecurity requirements.\n\nIf you are using jbossws-native, the fix for this flaw is implemented by\ntwo new configuration parameters in the 'encryption' element. This element\ncan be a child of 'requires' in both client and server wsse configuration\ndescriptors (set on a per-application basis via the application's\njboss-wsse-server.xml and jboss-wsse-client.xml files). The new attributes\nare 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms'. These attributes should contain a\nblank space or comma separated list of algorithm IDs that are allowed for\nthe encrypted incoming message, both for encryption and private key\nwrapping. For backwards compatibility, no algorithm checks are performed by\ndefault for empty lists or missing attributes.\n\nFor example (do not include the line break in your configuration):\n\nencryption algorithms=\"aes-192-gcm aes-256-gcm\"\nkeyWrapAlgorithms=\"rsa_oaep\"\n\nSpecifies that incoming messages are required to be encrypted, and that the\nonly permitted encryption algorithms are AES-192 and 256 in GCM mode, and\nRSA-OAEP only for key wrapping.\n\nBefore performing any decryption, the jbossws-native stack will verify that\neach algorithm specified in the incoming messages is included in the\nallowed algorithms lists from these new encryption element attributes. The\nalgorithm values to be used for 'algorithms' and 'keyWrapAlgorithms' are\nthe same as for 'algorithm' and 'keyWrapAlgorithm' in the 'encrypt'\nelement.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your existing JBoss\nEnterprise Web Platform installation (including all applications and\nconfiguration files).\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Web Platform 5.2.0 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\n    ",
