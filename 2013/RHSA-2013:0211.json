				"text": "\nThe Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a centralized management\nplatform that allows system administrators to view and manage virtual\nmachines. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager provides a\ncomprehensive range of features including search capabilities, resource\nmanagement, live migrations, and virtual infrastructure provisioning. The\nManager is a JBoss Application Server application that provides several\ninterfaces through which the virtual environment can be accessed and\ninteracted with, including an Administration Portal, a User Portal, and a\nRepresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface\n(API).\n\nIt was discovered that running the domain management tool with the validate\naction (\"rhevm-manage-domains -action=validate\") logged administrative\npasswords to a world-readable log file. A local attacker could use this\nflaw to gain control of systems that are managed by Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Manager. (CVE-2012-6115)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the MoveDisk command checked permissions on the\ntarget storage domain. A privileged user (a storage admin of a storage\ndomain) could use this flaw to exhaust all available free space in another\nstorage domain they would otherwise not have access to. (CVE-2013-0168)\n\nThe CVE-2012-6115 issue was discovered by Andrew Cathrow of Red Hat. The\nCVE-2013-0168 issue was discovered by Ondrej Machacek of Red Hat.\n\nPreviously, upgrading from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 to\n3.1 was not formally supported by Red Hat. This update fixes a number of\nknown issues with the upgrade process. As a result, upgrading from Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Manager 3.0 to 3.1 is now supported.\n\nFor more information on upgrading to Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nManager 3.1, consult the Installation Guide:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.1/html/Installation_Guide/chap-Upgrading_to_Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization_3.1.html\n\nAdditional tips and considerations to take into account are also available\nin the Red Hat Knowledgebase:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/269333\n\nInformation on the bugs fixed in this update is available in the Technical\nNotes document:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.1/html/Technical_Notes/chap-RHSA-2013-0211.html\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager administrators are advised to\ninstall these updated packages, which fix these issues.\n    ",
