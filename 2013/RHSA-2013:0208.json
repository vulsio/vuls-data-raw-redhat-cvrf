				"text": "\nThe openstack-nova packages provide OpenStack Compute (code name Nova), a\ncloud computing fabric controller.\n\nThe openstack-nova packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2012.2.2, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous version.\n\nThis update also fixes the following security issues:\n\nIt was found that the boot-from-volume feature in nova-volume did not\ncorrectly validate if the user attempting to boot an image was permitted\nto do so. An authenticated user could use this flaw to bypass\nintended restrictions, allowing them to boot images they would otherwise\nnot have access to, exposing data stored in other users' images. This\nissue did not affect configurations using the Cinder block storage\nmechanism, which is the default in Red Hat OpenStack. (CVE-2013-0208)\n\nWhen OpenStack Nova was configured to provide guest instances with libvirt\nand said guests used LVM-backed ephemeral storage\n(\"libvirt_images_type=lvm\" in \"/etc/nova/nova.conf\"), the contents of the\nphysical volume were not wiped before the volume was returned to the system\nfor use by a different guest instance. This could lead to a new instance\nbeing able to access files and data from a previous instance. This issue\ndid not affect configurations using the Cinder block storage mechanism,\nwhich is the default in Red Hat OpenStack. (CVE-2012-5625)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these\nissues. Upstream acknowledges Phil Day as the original reporter of\nCVE-2013-0208, and Eric Windisch as the original reporter of CVE-2012-5625.\n\nAll users of openstack-nova are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the Nova running services will be restarted automatically.\n    ",
