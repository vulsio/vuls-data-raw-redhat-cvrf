In\nsome environments, such as those using a non-default umask, a local\nattacker could possibly modify the answer file if PackStack was run in an\nattacker controlled directory, or attempted to create the answer file in\n\"/tmp/\", allowing the attacker to modify systems being deployed using\nOpenStack. Note: After applying this update, PackStack will create the\nanswer file in the user's home directory by default. It will no longer\ncreate it in the current working directory or the \"/tmp/\" directory by\ndefault. (CVE-2013-1815)\n\nThe CVE-2013-1815 issue was discovered by Derek Higgins of the Red Hat\nOpenStack team.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs in the openstack-packstack package.\n\nAll users of openstack-packstack are advised to upgrade to this updated\npackage, which corrects these issues.\n    ",
