				"text": "\nThe openstack-glance packages provide a service (code name Glance) that\nacts as a registry for virtual machine images.\n\nA flaw was found in the Glance download_image policy enforcement for cached\nsystem images. When an image was previously cached by an authorized\ndownload, any authenticated user able to determine the image by its UUID\ncould download that image, bypassing the download_image policy. Only setups\nmaking use of the download_image policy were affected. (CVE-2013-4428)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack Project for reporting this\nissue. The OpenStack Project acknowledges Stuart McLaren from HP as the\noriginal reporter.\n\nThese updated openstack-glance packages have been upgraded to upstream\nversion 2013.1.4, which provides a number of bug fixes over the previous\nversion. (BZ#1021640)\n\nAll users of openstack-glance are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the running Glance services must be manually restarted (using\n\"service [service name] restart\") for this update to take effect.\n    ",
