				"text": "\nJBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform is a business rules management system for\nthe management, storage, creation, modification, and deployment of JBoss\nRules.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for JBoss Enterprise BRMS\nPlatform 5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security\nissues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIf web services were deployed using Apache CXF with the WSS4JInInterceptor\nenabled to apply WS-Security processing, HTTP GET requests to these\nservices were always granted access, without applying authentication\nchecks. The URIMappingInterceptor is a legacy mechanism for allowing\nREST-like access (via GET requests) to simple SOAP services. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to access the REST-like interface of a simple\nSOAP service using GET requests that bypass the security constraints\napplied by WSS4JInInterceptor. This flaw was only exploitable if\nWSS4JInInterceptor was used to apply WS-Security processing. Services that\nuse WS-SecurityPolicy to apply security were not affected. (CVE-2012-5633)\n\nIt was found that Apache CXF was vulnerable to SOAPAction spoofing attacks\nunder certain conditions. If web services were exposed via Apache CXF that\nuse a unique SOAPAction for each service operation, then a remote attacker\ncould perform SOAPAction spoofing to call a forbidden operation if it\naccepts the same parameters as an allowed operation. WS-Policy validation\nwas performed against the operation being invoked, and an attack must pass\nvalidation to be successful. (CVE-2012-3451)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache CXF project for reporting the\nCVE-2012-3451 issue.\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss Enterprise\nBRMS Platform installation (including its databases, applications,\nconfiguration files, and so on).\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.\n    ",
