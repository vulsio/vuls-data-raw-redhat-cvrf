(BZ#950132)\n\nThis update also fixes the following security issue:\n\nIn environments using LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol), if\ndebug-level logging was enabled (for example, by enabling it in\n\"/etc/keystone/keystone.conf\"), the LDAP server password was logged in\nplain text to a world-readable log file. Debug-level logging is not enabled\nby default. (CVE-2013-2006)\n\nAdditionally, this update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* If the Keystone service incurred an HTTP error as a result of a transient\nnetwork error, authentication tokens were listed as invalid. With this\nupdate, the Keystone service will now retry requests a few times before\nfailing, which masks transient network errors. (BZ#919526)\n\n* The \"/var/log/keystone/\" directory was world-readable. With this update,\nworld-read permissions have been removed. (BZ#956474)\n\nAll users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues. After installing the updated\npackages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone) will be restarted\nautomatically.\n    ",
