				"text": "\nThis Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.1.0 release serves as a replacement for\n6.0.0. Refer to the 6.1.0 Release Notes for further information, available\nshortly from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/\n\nIt was found that sending a request without a session identifier to a\nprotected resource could bypass the CSRF prevention filter in JBoss Web. A\nremote attacker could use this flaw to perform CSRF attacks against\napplications that rely on the CSRF prevention filter. (CVE-2012-4431)\n\nWhen applications used the COOKIE session tracking method, the jsessionid\nwould be appended as a query string parameter when processing the first\nrequest of a session. This could possibly lead to users' sessions being\nhijacked via man-in-the-middle attacks. (CVE-2012-4529)\n\nIf multiple applications used the same custom authorization module class\nname, and provided their own implementations of it, the first application\nto be loaded will have its implementation used for all other applications\nusing the same custom authorization module class name. A local attacker\ncould deploy a malicious application that provides implementations of\ncustom authorization modules that apply authorization rules supplied by the\nattacker. (CVE-2012-4572)\n\nXML encryption backwards compatibility attacks were found against various\nframeworks, including Apache CXF. An attacker could force a server to use\ninsecure, legacy cryptosystems, even when secure cryptosystems were enabled\non endpoints. By forcing the use of legacy cryptosystems, flaws such as\nCVE-2011-1096 and CVE-2011-2487 would be exposed, allowing plain text to be\nrecovered from cryptograms and symmetric keys. (CVE-2012-5575)\n\nNote: Automatic checks to prevent CVE-2012-5575 are only run when\nWS-SecurityPolicy is used to enforce security requirements, which is best\npractice.\n\nThe data file used by PicketBox Vault to store encrypted passwords contains\na copy of its own admin key. The file is encrypted using only this admin\nkey, not the corresponding JKS key. A local attacker with permission to\nread the vault data file could read the admin key from the file.\n(CVE-2013-1921)\n\nA session fixation flaw was found in the Tomcat FormAuthenticator module.\n(CVE-2013-2067)\n\nWhen a JGroups channel was started, the JGroups diagnostics service was\nenabled by default with no authentication via IP multicast. An attacker on\nan adjacent network could exploit this flaw to read diagnostics\ninformation. (CVE-2013-2102)\n\nMultiple denial of service flaws were found in the way the Apache CXF StAX\nparser implementation processed certain XML files. A remote attacker could\nprovide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed, would lead to\nexcessive CPU and memory consumption. (CVE-2013-2160)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Apache Santuario XML Security for Java\nvalidated XML signatures. Santuario allowed a signature to specify an\narbitrary canonicalization algorithm, which would be applied to the\nSignedInfo XML fragment. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof an\nXML signature, via a specially-crafted XML signature block. (CVE-2013-2172)\n\nA flaw was found in JGroup's DiagnosticsHandler that allowed an attacker on\nan adjacent network to reuse the credentials from a previous successful\nauthentication. This could be exploited to read diagnostic information and\nattain limited remote code execution. (CVE-2013-4112)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the way authenticated connections were cached on\nthe server by remote-naming. After a user has successfully logged in, a\nremote attacker could use a remoting client to log in as that user without\nknowing their password, allowing them to access data and perform actions\nwith the privileges of that user. (CVE-2013-4128)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the way connections for remote EJB invocations via\nthe EJB client API were cached on the server. After a user has successfully\nlogged in, a remote attacker could use an EJB client to log in as that user\nwithout knowing their password. (CVE-2013-4213)\n    ",
