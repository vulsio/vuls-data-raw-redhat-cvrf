				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit combines popular open source web frameworks\ninto a single solution for Java applications.\n\nThis release serves as a replacement for Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit\n2.2.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the 2.3.0\nRelease Notes for information on the most significant of these changes,\navailable shortly from https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/\n\nThis release also fixes the following security issue:\n\nA flaw was found in the way RichFaces ResourceBuilderImpl handled\ndeserialization. A remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the\nexecution of the deserialization methods in any serializable class deployed\non the server. This could lead to a variety of security impacts depending\non the deserialization logic of these classes. (CVE-2013-2165)\n\nThe fix for this issue introduces a whitelist to limit classes that can be\ndeserialized by RichFaces.\n\nIf you require to whitelist a class that is not already listed, for\nexample, a custom class, you can achieve this by following one of these\nmethods:\n\nMethod 1: Implementing the SerializableResource interface.\nIn RichFaces 3, this is defined at\norg.ajax4jsf.resource.SerializableResource and in RichFaces 4/5, at\norg.richfaces.resource.SerializableResource.\n\nMethod 2: Adding the class to the resource-serialization.properties file\n(a default properties file is provided once this update is applied).\nTo do this you can extend the framework provided properties file that is\navailable under org.ajax4jsf.resource in RichFaces 3 and\norg.richfaces.resource in RichFaces 4/5. The modified properties file has\nto be copied into the classpath of your deployment under the\nversion-specific packages.\n\nWhere possible, it is recommended that Method 1 be followed.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Takeshi Terada (Mitsui Bussan Secure\nDirections, Inc.) for reporting this issue.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up your existing installation of\nRed Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform or Red Hat JBoss Web Server,\nand applications deployed to it.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit 2.2.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to Red Hat JBoss Web Framework\nKit 2.3.0.\n    ",
