A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)\nbase score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the\nCVE link in the References section.\n    ",

				"text": "\nPython-keystoneclient is the client library and command line utility for\ninteracting with the OpenStack identity API.\n\nA flaw was found in the way python-keystoneclient handled encrypted data\nfrom memcached. Even when the memcache_security_strategy setting in\n\"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf\" was set to ENCRYPT to help prevent\ntampering, an attacker on the local network, or possibly an unprivileged\nuser in a virtual machine hosted on OpenStack, could use this flaw to\nbypass intended restrictions and modify data in memcached that will later\nbe used by services utilizing python-keystoneclient (such as Nova, Cinder,\nSwift, Glance, and so on). (CVE-2013-2166)\n\nA flaw was found in the way python-keystoneclient verified data from\nmemcached. Even when the memcache_security_strategy setting in\n\"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf\" was set to MAC to perform signature\nchecking, an attacker on the local network, or possibly an unprivileged\nuser in a virtual machine hosted on OpenStack, could use this flaw to\nmodify data in memcached that will later pass signature checking in\npython-keystoneclient. (CVE-2013-2167)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these\nissues. Upstream acknowledges Paul McMillan of Nebula as the original\nreporter.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* python-webob1.2 (which can be installed in parallel with python-webob1.0)\nwas not found by python-keystoneclient. Attempting to import python-webob\nfrom python-keystoneclient failed with a stack trace. This could also be\nobserved with other applications using python-keystoneclient, such as\nOpenStack Swift. With this update, python-keystoneclient can import\npython-webob1.2 independently from other installed versions. (BZ#971026)\n\nAdditionally, this update adds the following enhancement:\n\n* This update adds support for Amazon Web Services (AWS) Signature Version\n4 to python-keystoneclient. This makes python-keystoneclient compatible\nwith future versions of python-boto, which will use Signature Version 4 by\ndefault. (BZ#970134)\n\nAll users of Red Hat OpenStack 3.0 (Grizzly) Preview are advised to install\nthese updated packages, which correct these issues and add this\nenhancement.\n    ",
