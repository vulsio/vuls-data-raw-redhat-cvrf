				"text": "\nThe rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA flaw was found in the way the vhost kernel module handled descriptors\nthat spanned multiple regions. A privileged guest user could use this flaw\nto crash the host or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the host.\n(CVE-2013-0311)\n\nIt was found that the default SCSI command filter does not accommodate\ncommands that overlap across device classes. A privileged guest user could\npotentially use this flaw to write arbitrary data to a LUN that is\npassed-through as read-only. (CVE-2012-4542)\n\nIt was discovered that dnsmasq, when used in combination with certain\nlibvirtd configurations, could incorrectly process network packets from\nnetwork interfaces that were intended to be prohibited. A remote,\nunauthenticated attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice via DNS amplification attacks. (CVE-2012-3411)\n\nThe CVE-2012-4542 issue was discovered by Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat.\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nseveral security issues. These issues had no security impact on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes\nincluded in this update address the following CVE numbers:\n\nCVE-2012-3955 (dhcp issue)\n\nCVE-2011-4355 (gdb issue)\n\nCVE-2012-4508, CVE-2013-0190, CVE-2013-0309, and CVE-2013-0310 (kernel\nissues)\n\nCVE-2012-5536 (openssh issue)\n\nCVE-2011-3148 and CVE-2011-3149 (pam issues)\n\nCVE-2013-0157 (util-linux-ng issue)\n\nThis updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor package also\nfixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the Administration Portal would always display the option to\nupgrade the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor ISO regardless of\nwhether or not the selected host was up-to-date. Now, the VDSM version\ncompatibility is considered and the upgrade message only displays if there\nis an upgrade relevant to the host available. (BZ#853092)\n\n* An out of date version of libvirt was included in the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Hypervisor 6.4 package. As a result, virtual machines with\nsupported CPU models were not being properly parsed by libvirt and failed\nto start. A more recent version of libvirt has been included in this\nupdated hypervisor package. Virtual machines now start normally.\n(BZ#895078)\n\nAs well, this update adds the following enhancement:\n\n* Hypervisor packages now take advantage of the installonlypkg function\nprovided by yum. This allows for multiple versions of the hypervisor\npackage to be installed on a system concurrently without making changes to\nthe yum configuration as was previously required. (BZ#863579)\n\nThis update includes the ovirt-node build from RHBA-2013:0556:\n\n    https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2013-0556.html\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues and adds this\nenhancement.\n    ",
