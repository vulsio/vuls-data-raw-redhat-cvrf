				"text": "\nRed Hat JBoss SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business process\nautomation infrastructure. Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform allows IT to leverage\nexisting (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future (EDA and\nCEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business process\nexecution speed and quality.\n\nThis roll up patch serves as a cumulative upgrade for Red Hat JBoss SOA\nPlatform 5.3.1. It includes various bug fixes. The following security\nissues are also fixed with this release:\n\nThe Jakarta Commons HttpClient component did not verify that the server\nhostname matched the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or\nsubjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a\nman-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a certificate\nthat was valid for any domain name. (CVE-2012-5783)\n\nA flaw in JRuby's JSON gem allowed remote attacks by creating different\ntypes of malicious objects. For example, it could initiate a denial of\nservice attack through resource consumption by using a JSON document to\ncreate arbitrary Ruby symbols, which were never garbage collected. It could\nalso be exploited to create internal objects which could allow a SQL\ninjection attack. (CVE-2013-0269)\n\nIt was discovered that JRuby's REXML library did not properly restrict XML\nentity expansion. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice by tricking a Ruby application using REXML to read text nodes from\nspecially-crafted XML content, which will result in REXML consuming large\namounts of system memory. (CVE-2013-1821)\n\nNote: Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform only provides JRuby as a dependency of\nthe scripting_chain quickstart example application. The CVE-2013-0269 and\nCVE-2013-1821 flaws are not exposed unless the version of JRuby shipped\nwith that quickstart is used by a deployed, custom application.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ruby on Rails upstream for reporting\nCVE-2013-0269. Upstream acknowledges Thomas Hollstegge of Zweitag and Ben\nMurphy as the original reporters of CVE-2013-0269.\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing Red Hat JBoss\nSOA Platform installation (including its databases, applications,\nconfiguration files, and so on).\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform 5.3.1 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to apply this roll up patch.\n    ",
