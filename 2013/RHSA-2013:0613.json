It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise\ncustomers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise\nMiddleware components that have been tested and certified together to\nprovide an integrated experience.\n\nIt was found that the GateIn Portal export/import gadget allowed an export\nZIP to be uploaded and imported to a site without authentication. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to modify the contents of a site, remove the\nsite, or modify access controls applied to portlets in the site.\n(CVE-2013-0314)\n\nIt was found that the GateIn Portal export/import gadget was vulnerable to\nXXE (XML External Entity) attacks. If the XML provided to the import gadget\ncontained an external XML entity, this XML entity would be resolved. A\nremote attacker who can access the import gadget could use this flaw to\nread files in the context of the user running the application server.\n(CVE-2013-0315)\n\nThe CVE-2013-0314 issue was discovered by Nick Scavelli of Red Hat, and\nCVE-2013-0315 was discovered by Arun Neelicattu and David Jorm of the Red\nHat Security Response Team.\n\nWarning: Before applying this update, back up all applications deployed on\nJBoss Enterprise Portal Platform, along with all customized configuration\nfiles, and any databases and database settings.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.\n    ",
