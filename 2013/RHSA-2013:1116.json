				"text": "\nRed Hat Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server. The base packages\ninclude the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) server and\ncommand-line utilities for server administration.\n\nIt was discovered that Red Hat Directory Server did not honor defined\nattribute access controls when evaluating search filter expressions. A\nremote attacker (with permission to query the Directory Server) could use\nthis flaw to determine the values of restricted attributes via a series of\nsearch queries with filter conditions that used restricted attributes.\n(CVE-2013-2219)\n\nThis issue was discovered by Ludwig Krispenz of Red Hat.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Prior to this update, the replication of the schema failed because of the\nattribute \"unhashed#user#password,\" which had an invalid name. When this\nproblem happened, the error logs recorded the message \"Schema\nreplication update failed: Invalid syntax.\" This update allows this\nattribute's name and the replication of the schema. (BZ#970934)\n\n* Prior to this update, under high load of incoming connections and due to\na race condition, a connection which was not yet fully initialized could\nstart being polled. This would lead to a crash. This update ensures that\nthe connection is fully initialized before being in the polling set.\n(BZ#954051)\n\n* Prior to this update, if some requested attributes were skipped during a\nsearch (for example, because of an ACI), the returned attribute names and\nvalues could be shifted. This update removes attributes that are not\nauthorized from the requested attributes set, so that the returned\nattributes/values are not shifted. (BZ#922773)\n\n* Prior to this update, when an attribute was configured to be encrypted,\nonline import failed to store it in an encrypted way. This update allows\nencryption, on the consumer side, during an online import. (BZ#893178)\n\n* Prior to this update, updating the redhat-ds-base package resulted in the\n\"/etc/dirsrv/slapd-[instance]/certmap.conf\" file being overwritten with the\ndefault template. With this update, upgrading the redhat-ds-base package no\nlonger causes \"/etc/dirsrv/slapd-[instance]/certmap.conf\" to be overwritten\nif the file already exists, preventing users from losing their custom\nchanges. (BZ#919154)\n\nAll users of Red Hat Directory Server 8.2 are advised to upgrade to these\nupdated packages, which fix these issues.\n    ",
