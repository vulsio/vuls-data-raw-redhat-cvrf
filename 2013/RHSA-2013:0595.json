				"text": "\nPackStack is a command line utility that uses Puppet modules to support\nrapid deployment of OpenStack on existing servers over an SSH connection.\nPackStack is suitable for deploying both single node proof of concept\ninstallations and more complex multi-node installations.\n\nA flaw was found in PackStack. During manifest creation, the manifest file\nwas written to /tmp/ with a predictable file name. A local attacker could\nuse this flaw to perform a symbolic link attack, overwriting an arbitrary\nfile accessible to the user running PackStack with the contents of the\nmanifest, which could lead to a denial of service. Additionally, the\nattacker could read and potentially modify the manifest being generated,\nallowing them to modify systems being deployed using OpenStack.\n(CVE-2013-0261)\n\nIt was discovered that the cinder.conf and all api-paste.ini configuration\nfiles were created with world-readable permissions. A local attacker could\nuse this flaw to view administrative passwords, allowing them to control\nsystems deployed and managed by OpenStack. (CVE-2013-0266)\n\nThe CVE-2013-0261 issue was discovered by Kurt Seifried of the Red Hat\nSecurity Response Team, and CVE-2013-0266 was discovered by Derek Higgins\nof the Red Hat OpenStack team.\n\nThis update also fixes several bugs in the openstack-packstack package.\n\nAll users of openstack-packstack are advised to upgrade to this updated\npackage, which corrects these issues.\n    ",
