				"text": "\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server. \n\nA number of buffer overflow flaws were found in the PHP session extension;\nthe str_replace() function; and the imap_mail_compose() function. If very\nlong strings were passed to the str_replace() function, an integer overflow\ncould occur in memory allocation. If a script used the imap_mail_compose()\nfunction to create a new MIME message based on an input body from an\nuntrusted source, it could result in a heap overflow. An attacker with\naccess to a PHP application affected by any these issues could trigger the\nflaws and possibly execute arbitrary code as the 'apache' user.\n(CVE-2007-0906)\n\nWhen unserializing untrusted data on 64-bit platforms, the zend_hash_init()\nfunction could be forced into an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources for\na limited time, until the script timeout alarm aborted execution of the\nscript. (CVE-2007-0988)\n\nIf the wddx extension was used to import WDDX data from an untrusted\nsource, certain WDDX input packets could expose a random portion of heap\nmemory. (CVE-2007-0908)\n\nIf the odbc_result_all() function was used to display data from a database,\nand the database table contents were under an attacker's control, a format\nstring vulnerability was possible which could allow arbitrary code\nexecution. (CVE-2007-0909)\n\nA one byte memory read always occurs before the beginning of a buffer. This\ncould be triggered, for example, by any use of the header() function in a\nscript. However it is unlikely that this would have any effect.\n(CVE-2007-0907)\n\nSeveral flaws in PHP could allow attackers to \"clobber\" certain\nsuper-global variables via unspecified vectors. (CVE-2007-0910)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Stefan Esser for his help diagnosing these issues.\n    ",
