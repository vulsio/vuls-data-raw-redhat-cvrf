This\nrelease contained a new version of MySQL that corrected several security\nissues found in the MySQL packages of Red Hat Application Stack v1.1.\n\nUsers who have already updated to Red Hat Application Stack v1.2 will\nalready have the new MySQL packages and are not affected by these issues.\n\nA flaw was discovered in MySQL's authentication protocol. A remote\nunauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted authentication\nrequest to the MySQL server causing it to crash. (CVE-2007-3780)\n\nMySQL did not require privileges such as SELECT for the source table in a\nCREATE TABLE LIKE statement. A remote authenticated user could obtain\nsensitive information such as the table structure. (CVE-2007-3781)\n\nA flaw was discovered in MySQL that allowed remote authenticated\nusers to gain update privileges for a table in another database via a view\nthat refers to the external table (CVE-2007-3782).\n\nA flaw was discovered in the mysql_change_db function when returning from\nSQL SECURITY INVOKER stored routines.  A remote authenticated user could\nuse this flaw to gain database privileges. (CVE-2007-2692)\n\nMySQL did not require the DROP privilege for RENAME TABLE statements.  A\nremote authenticated users could use this flaw to rename arbitrary tables.\n(CVE-2007-2691)\n    ",
