				"text": "\nThe Conga package is a web-based administration tool for remote cluster and\nstorage management.\n\nA flaw was found in ricci during a code audit. A remote attacker who is\nable to connect to ricci could cause ricci to temporarily refuse additional\nconnections, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2007-4136)\n\nAdditionally, these updated packages fix the following bugs:\n\n* entering an invalid password when creating a new cluster with the luci\nweb application caused a \"UnboundLocalError\" error.\n\n* conga did not set the the \"nodename\" attribute for instances of manual\nfencing, resulting in manual fencing being non-functional.\n\n* conga did not provide a way to remove a dead node from a cluster.\nAttempting to remove a dead node from a cluster resulted in an error,\nreporting that that the node name cannot be reached.\n\n* during cluster formation Conga reboots the cluster nodes. During reboot\nerrors about not being able to communicate with nodes are displayed. These\nerrors can safely be ignored, and have been removed in these updated\npackages.\n\n* when building a new cluster on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Conga did not\ngenerate node ID attributes for clusternode tags. The node ID attributes\nare needed by programs such as qdisk.\n\n* during Quorum Partition Configuration, a \"TypeError\" error occurred if\nyou did not configure heuristics.\n\n* when passing arguments to fence_scsi, Conga used the \"nodename\" attribute\ninstead of the \"node\" attribute, resulting in an invalid XML file being\npassed to fence_scsi. The \"nodename\" attribute is now supported.\n\n* conga did not handle the restart operation correctly. In certain\nsituations this resulted in nodes not being started, stopped, and restarted\ncorrectly. These issues were caused by clusters starting while others were\nstill in the process of stopping. This has been resolved in these updated\npackages.\n\n* probing storage using luci and the Mozilla Firefox 2 web browser on\nMicrosoft Windows XP appeared to never finish, when in fact it had. After\nprobing, clicking the node name in the storage list correctly showed the\nstorage for that node.\n\nAs well, these updated packages add the following enhancements:\n\n* the Conga web interface now supports the Microsoft Internet Explorer web\nbrowser, versions 6.0 and later.\n\n* in previous packages, Conga required a minimum score to be configured\neven when heuristics were not being used. A minimum score is no longer\nrequired.\n\nAll Conga users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which\nfix this vulnerability, resolve these issues, and add these enhancements.\n    ",
