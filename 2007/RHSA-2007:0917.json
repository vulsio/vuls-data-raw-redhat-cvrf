			{
				"text": "\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\n\nThese updated packages address the following vulnerabilities:\n\nVarious integer overflow flaws were found in the PHP gd extension. A\nscript that could be forced to resize images from an untrusted source could\npossibly allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the apache\nuser. (CVE-2007-3996)\n\nA previous security update introduced a bug into PHP session cookie\nhandling. This could allow an attacker to stop a victim from viewing a\nvulnerable web site if the victim has first visited a malicious web page\nunder the control of the attacker, and that page can set a cookie for the\nvulnerable web site. (CVE-2007-4670)\n\nA flaw was found in the PHP money_format function. If a remote attacker\nwas able to pass arbitrary data to the money_format function this could\npossibly result in an information leak or denial of service. Note that is\nis unusual for a PHP script to pass user-supplied data to the money_format\nfunction. (CVE-2007-4658)\n\nA flaw was found in the PHP wordwrap function. If a remote attacker was\nable to pass arbitrary data to the wordwrap function this could possibly\nresult in a denial of service. (CVE-2007-3998)\n\nA bug was found in PHP session cookie handling. This could allow an\nattacker to create a cross-site cookie insertion attack if a victim follows\nan untrusted carefully-crafted URL. (CVE-2007-3799)\n\nA flaw was found in handling of dynamic changes to global variables. A\nscript which used certain functions which change global variables could\nbe forced to enable the register_globals configuration option, possibly\nresulting in global variable injection. (CVE-2007-4659) \n\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the PHP chunk_split function. If a\nremote attacker was able to pass arbitrary data to the third argument of\nchunk_split they could possibly execute arbitrary code as the apache user.\nNote that it is unusual for a PHP script to use the chunk_split function\nwith a user-supplied third argument. (CVE-2007-4661)\n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.\n    ",
