			{
				"text": "\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server. \n\nA number of buffer overflow flaws were found in the PHP session extension;\nthe str_replace() function; and the imap_mail_compose() function. If very\nlong strings were passed to the str_replace() function, an integer overflow\ncould occur in memory allocation. If a script used the imap_mail_compose()\nfunction to create a new MIME message based on an input body from an\nuntrusted source, it could result in a heap overflow. An attacker with\naccess to a PHP application affected by any these issues could trigger the\nflaws and possibly execute arbitrary code as the 'apache' user.\n(CVE-2007-0906)\n\nWhen unserializing untrusted data on 64-bit platforms, the zend_hash_init()\nfunction could be forced into an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources for\na limited time, until the script timeout alarm aborted execution of the\nscript. (CVE-2007-0988)\n\nIf the wddx extension was used to import WDDX data from an untrusted\nsource, certain WDDX input packets could expose a random portion of heap\nmemory. (CVE-2007-0908)\n\nIf the odbc_result_all() function was used to display data from a database,\nand the database table contents were under an attacker's control, a format\nstring vulnerability was possible which could allow arbitrary code\nexecution. (CVE-2007-0909)\n\nA one byte memory read always occurs before the beginning of a buffer. This\ncould be triggered, for example, by any use of the header() function in a\nscript. However it is unlikely that this would have any effect.\n(CVE-2007-0907)\n\nSeveral flaws in PHP could allow attackers to \"clobber\" certain\nsuper-global variables via unspecified vectors. (CVE-2007-0910)\n\nUsers of Stronghold should upgrade to these updated packages which contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Stefan Esser for his help diagnosing these issues.\n    ",

						"text": "\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
