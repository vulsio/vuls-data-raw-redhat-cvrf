If Tomcat was used behind mod_jk and configured to only\nproxy some contexts, an attacker could construct a carefully crafted HTTP\nrequest to work around the context restriction and potentially access\nnon-proxied content (CVE-2007-1860).\n\nUsers of mod_jk should upgrade to these updated packages, which address\nthis issue by changing the default so mod_jk forwards the original\nunchanged request URL to Tomcat.\n    ",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates. To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
