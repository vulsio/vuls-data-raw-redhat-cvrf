				"text": "\nTomcat is a servlet container for Java Servlet and JavaServer Pages\ntechnologies.\n\nTomcat was found to accept multiple content-length headers in a\nrequest. This could allow attackers to poison a web-cache, bypass web\napplication firewall protection, or conduct cross-site scripting attacks. \n(CVE-2005-2090)\n\nTomcat permitted various characters as path delimiters. If Tomcat was used\nbehind certain proxies and configured to only proxy some contexts, an\nattacker could construct an HTTP request to work around the context\nrestriction and potentially access non-proxied content. (CVE-2007-0450)\n\nSeveral applications distributed in the JSP examples displayed unfiltered\nvalues. If the JSP examples are accessible, these flaws could allow a\nremote attacker to perform cross-site scripting attacks. (CVE-2005-4838,\nCVE-2006-7195, CVE-2006-7196)\n\nThe default Tomcat configuration permitted the use of insecure\nSSL cipher suites including the anonymous cipher suite. (CVE-2007-1858)\n\nDirectory listings were enabled by default in Tomcat. Information stored\nunprotected under the document root was visible to anyone if the\nadministrator did not disable directory listings. (CVE-2006-3835)\n\nIt was found that generating listings of large directories was CPU\nintensive.  An attacker could make repeated requests to obtain a directory\nlisting of any large directory, leading to a denial of service. \n(CVE-2005-3510)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these erratum packages which contain an update to\nTomcat and the addition of backported security patches to resolve these issues.\n    ",

						"text": "\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
