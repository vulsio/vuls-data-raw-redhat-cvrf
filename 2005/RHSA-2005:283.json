				"text": "\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating system.\n\nThis is the seventh regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1\n\nThe following security updates were made:\n\nA flaw in fragment queuing was discovered that affected the Linux 2.4 and\nLinux 2.6 kernel netfilter subsystem. On systems configured to filter or\nprocess network packets (for example those configured to do firewalling),\na remote attacker could send a carefully crafted set of fragmented packets\nto a machine and cause a denial of service (system crash). In order to\nsucessfully exploit this flaw, the attacker would need to know (or guess)\nsome aspects of the firewall ruleset in place on the target system to be\nable to craft the right fragmented packets. (CAN-2005-0449)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux PPP driver. On systems allowing remote\nusers to connect to a server using ppp, a remote client could cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CAN-2005-0384)\n\nA flaw was discovered in the bluetooth driver system. On system where the\nbluetooth modules are loaded, a local user could use this flaw to gain\nelevated (root) privileges. (CAN-2005-0750)\n\nAn integer overflow flaw was discovered in the ubsec_keysetup function\nin the Broadcom 5820 cryptonet driver. On systems using this driver,\na local user could cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain\nelevated privileges. (CAN-2004-0619) Please note that this update contains\nan unpatched kernel module called bcm5820_old for backwards compatibility\nwhich is still vulnerable to CAN-2004-0619. \n\nThe following device drivers have been updated to new versions:\n\n    mptfusion: 2.05.16 -> 2.05.16.02\n    bcm5820: 1.17 -> 1.81\n    cciss: 2.4.52 -> 2.4.54\n    qla2x00: 6.04.01 -> 7.01.01\n\nThere were many bug fixes in various parts of the kernel. The ongoing\neffort to resolve these problems has resulted in a marked improvement\nin the reliability and scalability of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1.\n\nBug fixes include:\n    - Fixes an incorrect and ever-changing physical_id field in\n      /proc/cpuinfo.\n    - Now recognizes a particular e1000 device (PCI ID 8086:1014)\n    - Fixes a panic in disk quota code\n    - Fixes a bug in which msync(...MS_SYNC) returns before the data\n      is written to disk\n    - Adds new devices to the SCSI scan list so they can\n      be initialized and handled properly: LSI ProFibre 4000R, HP\n      HSV200/210, HP MSA, STK OPENstorage D178.\n    - Fixes a potential format overflow in /proc/partitions\n    - Restores module parameters to the e100 driver for compatibility with     \n      existing customer scripts.\n    - Fixes a bug in which cat'ing /proc/mdstat while adding/removing\n      devices can cause a kernel oops\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their\nkernels to the packages associated with their machine architectures\nand configurations as listed in this erratum.\n\nPlease note that a vulnerability addressed by this update (CAN-2005-0449)\nrequired a change to the kernel module ABI which could cause third party\nmodules to not work. However, Red Hat is currently not aware of any module\nthat would be affected by this change.\n    ",
