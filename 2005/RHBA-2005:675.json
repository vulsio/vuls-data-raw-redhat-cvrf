The bug fix caused a\nsignificant slow-down of gcore.\n\n- GDB on Itanium issued an extraneous warning when gcore was used.\n\n- GDB on Itanium could not successfully do an info frame for a signal\ntrampoline.\n\n- GDB on AMD64 and Intel EM64T had problems attaching to a 32-bit process.\n\n- GDB on AMD64 and Intel EM64T was not properly handling threaded watchpoints.\n\n- GDB could not build with gcc4 when -Werror flag was set.\n\n- GDB had problems printing inherited members of C++ classes.\n\n- A few updates from mainline sources concerning Dwarf2 partial die in\ncache support, follow-fork support, interrupted syscall support, and\nDW_OP_piece read support.\n\nAll users of gdb should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.\n    ",
