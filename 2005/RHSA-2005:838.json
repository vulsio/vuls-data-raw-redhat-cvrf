				"text": "\nPHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language commonly used with the Apache\nHTTP Web server.\n\nA flaw was found in the way PHP registers global variables during a file\nupload request.  A remote attacker could submit a carefully crafted\nmultipart/form-data POST request that would overwrite the $GLOBALS array,\naltering expected script behavior, and possibly leading to the execution of\narbitrary PHP commands.  Note that this vulnerability only affects\ninstallations which have register_globals enabled in the PHP configuration\nfile, which is not a default or recommended option.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project assigned the name CVE-2005-3390 to\nthis issue.\n\nA flaw was found in the PHP parse_str() function. If a PHP script passes\nonly one argument to the parse_str() function, and the script can be forced\nto abort execution during operation (for example due to the memory_limit\nsetting), the register_globals may be enabled even if it is disabled in the\nPHP configuration file.  This vulnerability only affects installations that\nhave PHP scripts using the parse_str function in this way.  (CVE-2005-3389)\n\nA Cross-Site Scripting flaw was found in the phpinfo() function. If a\nvictim can be tricked into following a malicious URL to a site with a page\ndisplaying the phpinfo() output, it may be possible to inject javascript\nor HTML content into the displayed page or steal data such as cookies. \nThis vulnerability only affects installations which allow users to view the\noutput of the phpinfo() function.  As the phpinfo() function outputs a\nlarge amount of information about the current state of PHP, it should only\nbe used during debugging or if protected by authentication.  (CVE-2005-3388)\n\nAdditionally, a bug introduced in the updates to fix CVE-2004-1019 has been\ncorrected.\n\nUsers of PHP should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported patches that resolve these issues.\n    ",
