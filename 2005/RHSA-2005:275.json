A local user could create an\ninterpreter name string that is not NULL terminated, leading to a denial of\nservice (crash).  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-1072 to this issue.\n\nThis update also addresses the following issues:\n\n-- Fixed execve to invoke ia32 interpreter\n-- Credential fixes\n-- Fixed a bug causing ibm-jvm to fail\n-- Other minor bug fixes\n\nPlease refer to the package release notes for detailed information about\nthese changes.\n\nAll users of ia32el should upgrade to this updated package, which\nresolves these issues.\n    ",

Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
