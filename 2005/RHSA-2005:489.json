The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-1999-0710 to this issue.\n \nA bug was found in the way Squid handles DNS replies.  If the port Squid\nuses for DNS requests is not protected by a firewall, it is possible for a\nremote attacker to spoof DNS replies, possibly redirecting a user to\nspoofed or malicious content. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name  CAN-2005-1519 to this issue. \n \nAdditionally, this update fixes the following bugs:   \n - squid fails in the unpacking of squid-2.4.STABLE7-1.21as.5.src.rpm\n \nUsers of Squid should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches to correct these issues.\n    ",
