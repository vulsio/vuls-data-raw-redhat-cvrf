These\nfunctions fail to properly remove various markup tags within an IRC\nmessage. It is possible that a remote attacker could send a specially\ncrafted message to a Gaim client connected to an IRC server, causing it to\ncrash. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2005-0966 to this issue.\n\nA bug was found in gaim's Jabber message parser.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2005-0967 to this issue.\n\nIn addition to these denial of service issues, multiple minor upstream\nbugfixes are included in this update.\n\nUsers of Gaim are advised to upgrade to this updated package which contains\nGaim version 1.2.1 and is not vulnerable to these issues.\n    ",
