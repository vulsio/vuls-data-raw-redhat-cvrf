If an attacker is able to\ninject an arbitrary string into the /var/log/secure file, it is possible to\nprevent logwatch from detecting malicious activity. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-1061 to this issue.\n\nAll users of logwatch are advised to upgrade to this updated\npackage, which contain backported fixes for this issue.\n    ",

Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n    ",
