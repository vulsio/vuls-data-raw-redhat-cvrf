The library uses pluggable\nback-ends to interface to its data sources. Sample applications that are\nmodeled after applications from the shadow password suite are included in\nthe package.\n\nSeveral denial of service bugs were discovered in libuser. Under certain\nconditions it is possible for an application linked against libuser to\ncrash or operate irregularly. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-2392 to these issues.\n\nAll users of libuser are advised to upgrade to these updated packages,\nwhich contain a backported fix and are not vulnerable to these issues.\n    ",
