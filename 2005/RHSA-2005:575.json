It is\npossible to execute arbitrary code on a victim's machine if the victim is\ntricked into opening a malicious PDF file. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project has assigned the name CAN-2005-1625 to this issue.\n\nPlease note that there is no browser plugin included with the x86_64 Adobe\nAcrobat Reader package; Therefore the security impact of this issue on\nx86_64 is reduced from \"critical\" to \"important\".\n\nAdditionally Secunia Research discovered a bug in the way Adobe Acrobat\nReader creates temporary files. When a user opens a document, temporary\nfiles are created which may be world readable, allowing a local user to\nview sensitive information. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject has assigned the name CAN-2005-1841 to this issue.\n\nAll users of Acrobat Reader are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain Acrobat Reader version 7.0.0 and are not vulnerable\nto this issue.\n    ",
