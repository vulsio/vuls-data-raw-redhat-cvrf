				"text": "\nThe rsh package contains a set of programs that allow users to run\ncommands on remote machines, login to other machines, and copy files\nbetween machines, using the rsh, rlogin, and rcp commands. All three of\nthese commands use rhosts-style authentication.\n\nThe rcp protocol allows a server to instruct a client to write to arbitrary\nfiles outside of the current directory. This could potentially cause a\nsecurity issue if a user uses rcp to copy files from a malicious server.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2004-0175 to this issue.\n\nThese updated packages also address the following bugs:\n\nThe rlogind server reported \"SIGCHLD set to SIG_IGN but calls wait()\"\nmessage to the system log because the original BSD code was ported\nincorrectly to linux.\n\nThe rexecd server did not function on systems where client hostnames were\nnot in the DNS service, because server code called gethostbyaddr() for each\nnew connection.\n\nThe rcp command incorrectly used the \"errno\" variable and produced\nerroneous error messages.\n\nThe rexecd command ignored settings in the /etc/security/limits file,\nbecause the PAM session was incorrectly initialized.\n\nAll users of rsh should upgrade to these updated packages, which resolve\nthese issues.\n    ",

						"text": "\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL\nCertificate Errors, you need to install a version of the\nup2date client with an updated certificate.  The latest version of\nup2date is available from the Red Hat FTP site and may also be\ndownloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt\n    ",
