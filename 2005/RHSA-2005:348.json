A user with the ability to create and execute a user defined\nfunction could potentially execute arbitrary code on the MySQL server. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe names CAN-2005-0709 and CAN-2005-0710 to these issues.\n\nStefano Di Paola also discovered a bug in the way MySQL creates temporary\ntables. A local user could create a specially crafted symlink which could\nresult in the MySQL server overwriting a file which it has write access to.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-0711 to this issue.\n\nAll users of the MySQL server are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which contain fixes for these issues.\n    ",
