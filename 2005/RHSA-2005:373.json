				"text": "\nSNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is a protocol used for network\nmanagement.\n\nA denial of service bug was found in the way net-snmp uses network stream\nprotocols. It is possible for a remote attacker to send a net-snmp agent a\nspecially crafted packet which will crash the agent. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2005-2177 to this issue.\n\nAn insecure temporary file usage bug was found in net-snmp's fixproc\ncommand. It is possible for a local user to modify the content of temporary\nfiles used by fixproc which can lead to arbitrary command execution. The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2005-1740 to this issue.\n\nAdditionally the following bugs have been fixed:\n - snmpwalk no longer hangs when a non-existant pid is listed. \n - snmpd no longer segfaults due to incorrect handling of lmSensors. \n - an incorrect assignment leading to invalid values in ASN mibs has been\n   fixed.\n - on systems running a 64-bit kernel, the values in /proc/net/dev no \n   longer become too large to fit in a 32-bit object. \n - the net-snmp-devel packages correctly depend on elfutils-libelf-devel.\n - large file systems are correctly handled\n - snmp daemon now reports gigabit Ethernet speeds correctly\n - fixed consistency between IP adresses and hostnames in configuration file\n\nAll users of net-snmp should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.\n    ",
