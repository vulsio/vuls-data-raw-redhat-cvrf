				"text": "\nJBoss Enterprise SOA Platform is the next-generation ESB and business\nprocess automation infrastructure. JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform allows IT\nto leverage existing (MoM and EAI), modern (SOA and BPM-Rules), and future\n(EDA and CEP) integration methodologies to dramatically improve business\nprocess execution speed and quality. The Java Naming and Directory\nInterface (JNDI) Java API allows Java software clients to locate objects or\nservices in an application server.\n\nIt was found that the JBoss JNDI service allowed unauthenticated, remote\nwrite access by default. The JNDI and HA-JNDI services, and the\nHAJNDIFactory invoker servlet were all affected. A remote attacker able to\naccess the JNDI service (port 1099), HA-JNDI service (port 1100), or the\nHAJNDIFactory invoker servlet on a JBoss server could use this flaw to add,\ndelete, and modify items in the JNDI tree. This could have various,\napplication-specific impacts. (CVE-2011-4605)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Christian Schlüter (VIADA) for reporting this\nissue.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise SOA Platform 4.2.0.CP05 and 4.3.0.CP05 as\nprovided from the Red Hat Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.\n    ",
