				"text": "\nThe openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation\nof the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,\nCatalog, and Policy services.\n\nThe openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2012.2.1, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the\nprevious version. (BZ#883829)\n\nThis update also fixes the following security issues:\n\nA flaw in Keystone allowed an attacker with access to the web and network  \ninterfaces to continue using chained tokens linked to tokens that had \nexpired. This would allow the attacker to continue using the tokens despite \nthe parent token being expired, giving them continued access to OpenStack \nservices. (CVE-2012-5563)\n\nIt was found that Keystone did not correctly handle users being removed\nfrom tenants when Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) style\ncredentials (credentials that are issued in the same format as standard\nAmazon EC2 credentials) were in use. When a user was removed from a tenant,\nthey retained the privileges provided by that tenant, allowing them to\naccess resources they should no longer have access to. (CVE-2012-5571)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting these\nissues. Upstream acknowledges Anndy as the original reporter of\nCVE-2012-5563, and Vijaya Erukala as the original reporter of\nCVE-2012-5571.\n\nAll users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements. After\ninstalling the updated packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone)\nwill be restarted automatically.\n    ",
