The Python scripts\nneeded to configure the host for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were\nstored in the \"/tmp/\" directory and could be pre-created by an attacker. A\nlocal, unprivileged user on the host to be added to the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization environment could use this flaw to escalate their\nprivileges. This update provides the VDSM part of the fix. The\nRHSA-2012:1506 Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager update must also\nbe installed to completely fix this issue. (CVE-2012-0860)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Hypervisor hosts were added to the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization environment. The Python scripts needed to configure the host\nfor Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were downloaded in an insecure way,\nthat is, without properly validating SSL certificates during HTTPS\nconnections. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to\nconduct a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially gaining root access to the\nhost being added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. This\nupdate provides the VDSM part of the fix. The RHSA-2012:1506 Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Manager update must also be installed to\ncompletely fix this issue. (CVE-2012-0861)\n\nThe CVE-2012-0860 and CVE-2012-0861 issues were discovered by Red Hat.\n\nIn addition to resolving the above security issues these updated VDSM\npackages fix various bugs, and add various enhancements.\n\nDocumentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available in the\nTechnical Notes:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.1/html/Technical_Notes/index.html\n\nAll users who require VDSM are advised to install these updated packages\nwhich resolve these security issues, fix these bugs, and add these\nenhancements.\n    ",
