				"text": "\nJBoss Enterprise Portal Platform is the open source implementation of the\nJava EE suite of services and Portal services running atop JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform. It comprises a set of offerings for enterprise\ncustomers who are looking for pre-configured profiles of JBoss Enterprise\nMiddleware components that have been tested and certified together to\nprovide an integrated experience.\n\nAn attack technique was found against the W3C XML Encryption Standard when\nblock ciphers were used in cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode. A remote\nattacker could use this flaw to conduct chosen-ciphertext attacks, leading\nto the recovery of the entire plain text of a particular cryptogram by\nexamining the differences between SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)\nresponses sent from JBoss Web Services. (CVE-2011-1096)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Juraj Somorovsky of Ruhr-University Bochum\nfor reporting this issue.\n\nNote: Manual action is required to apply this update. The CVE-2011-1096\nissue is an attack on the WS-Security standard itself. Using new\nGalois/Counter Mode (GCM) based algorithms for WS-Security encryption is\nthe W3C suggested way of dealing with this issue. The WS-SecurityPolicy\nspecification has not yet been updated to include the new algorithms.\nConsequently, Apache CXF independently added support for such GCM based\nalgorithms through AlgorithmSuites called \"Basic128GCM\", \"Basic192GCM\", and\n\"Basic256GCM\" in the namespace\n\"http://cxf.apache.org/custom/security-policy\".\n\nTo apply these policies to your applications that use WS-Security\nencryption, specify them in the application's WSDL file. Refer to Red Hat\nBugzilla bug 681916 for an example.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform 5.2.2 as provided from the\nRed Hat Customer Portal are advised to install this update.\n    ",
