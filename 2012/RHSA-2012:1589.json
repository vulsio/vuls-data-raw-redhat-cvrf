				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's dl2k driver, used by\ncertain D-Link Gigabit Ethernet adapters, restricted IOCTLs. A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to issue potentially harmful IOCTLs,\nwhich could cause Ethernet adapters using the dl2k driver to malfunction\n(for example, losing network connectivity). (CVE-2012-2313, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Stephan Mueller for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* The kernel allows high priority real time tasks, such as tasks scheduled\nwith the SCHED_FIFO policy, to be throttled. Previously, the CPU stop tasks\nwere scheduled as high priority real time tasks and could be thus throttled\naccordingly. However, the replenishment timer, which is responsible for\nclearing a throttle flag on tasks, could be pending on the just disabled\nCPU. This could lead to the situation that the throttled tasks were never\nscheduled to run. Consequently, if any of such tasks was needed to complete\nthe CPU disabling, the system became unresponsive. This update introduces a\nnew scheduler class, which gives a task the highest possible system\npriority and such a task cannot be throttled. The stop-task scheduling\nclass is now used for the CPU stop tasks, and the system shutdown completes\nas expected in the scenario described. (BZ#876077)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
