				"text": "\nKVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a full virtualization solution for\nLinux on AMD64 and Intel 64 systems. The qemu-kvm-rhev packages form the\nuser-space component for running virtual machines using KVM.\n\nA flaw was found in the way QEMU handled VT100 terminal escape sequences\nwhen emulating certain character devices. A guest user with privileges to\nwrite to a character device that is emulated on the host using a virtual\nconsole back-end could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the\nhost or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2012-3515)\n\nWhen using qemu-kvm-rhev on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 host not managed\nby Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization:\n\n* This flaw did not affect the default use of KVM. Affected configurations\nwere:\n\n- When guests were started from the command line (\"/usr/libexec/qemu-kvm\")\nwithout the \"-nodefaults\" option, and also without specifying a\nserial or parallel device, or a virtio-console device, that specifically\ndoes not use a virtual console (vc) back-end. (Note that Red Hat does not\nsupport invoking \"qemu-kvm\" from the command line without \"-nodefaults\" on\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6.)\n\n- Guests that were managed via libvirt, such as when using Virtual Machine\nManager (virt-manager), but that have a serial or parallel device, or a\nvirtio-console device, that uses a virtual console back-end. By default,\nguests managed via libvirt will not use a virtual console back-end for such\ndevices.\n\nWhen using qemu-kvm-rhev on a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization managed Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 6 host:\n\n* This flaw did not affect the default use of a Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization host: it is not possible to add a device that uses a virtual\nconsole back-end via Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.\n\nTo specify a virtual console back-end for a device and therefore be\nvulnerable to this issue, the device would have to be created another way,\nfor example, by using a VDSM hook.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* Previously, the KVM modules were not loaded by the postinstall scriptlet\nof RPM scripts. This bug caused various issues and required the system to\nbe rebooted to resolve them. With this update, the modules are loaded\nproperly by the scriptlet and no unnecessary reboots are now required.\n(BZ#839897)\n\n* Previously, when a guest was started up with two serial devices, qemu-kvm\nreturned an error message and terminated the boot because IRQ 4 for the ISA\nbus was being used by both devices. This update fixes the qemu-kvm code,\nwhich allows IRQ 4 to be used by more than one device on the ISA bus, and\nthe boot now succeeds in the described scenario. (BZ#840054)\n\nAll users of qemu-kvm-rhev are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which fix these issues. After installing this update, shut down\nall running virtual machines. Once all virtual machines have shut down,\nstart them again for this update to take effect.\n    ",
