				"text": "\nJBoss Operations Network (JBoss ON) is a middleware management solution\nthat provides a single point of control to deploy, manage, and monitor\nJBoss Enterprise Middleware, applications, and services.\n\nThis JBoss ON 3.0.1 release serves as a replacement for JBoss ON 3.0.0, and\nincludes several bug fixes. Refer to the JBoss ON 3.0.1 Release Notes for\ninformation on the most significant of these changes. The Release Notes\nwill be available shortly from\nhttps://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/index.html\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nJBoss ON did not properly verify security tokens, allowing an unapproved\nagent to connect as an approved agent. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to spoof the identity of an approved agent, allowing them to hijack\nthe approved agent's session and steal its security token. As a result,\nthe attacker could retrieve sensitive data about the server the hijacked\nagent was running on, including JMX credentials. (CVE-2012-0052)\n\nJBoss ON sometimes allowed agent registration to succeed when the\nregistration request did not include a security token. This is a feature\ndesigned to add convenience. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nspoof the identity of an approved agent and pass a null security token,\nallowing them to hijack the approved agent's session, and steal its\nsecurity token. As a result, the attacker could retrieve sensitive data\nabout the server the hijacked agent was running on, including JMX\ncredentials. (CVE-2012-0062)\n\nA flaw was found in the way LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)\nauthentication was handled. If the LDAP bind account credentials became\ninvalid, subsequent log in attempts with any password for user accounts\ncreated via LDAP were successful. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\nlog into LDAP-based JBoss ON accounts without knowing the correct\npasswords. (CVE-2012-1100)\n\nIt was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was susceptible\nto predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\ncause JBoss Web to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP\nrequest with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same hash\nvalue. This update introduces a limit on the number of parameters and\nheaders processed per request to mitigate this issue. The default limit is\n512 for parameters and 128 for headers. These defaults can be changed by\nsetting the org.apache.tomcat.util.http.Parameters.MAX_COUNT and\norg.apache.tomcat.util.http.MimeHeaders.MAX_COUNT system properties in\n\"server/$PROFILE/deploy/properties-service.xml\". (CVE-2011-4858)\n\nIt was found that after installing the remote client (by extracting\nrhq-remoting-cli-[version].zip), its root directory had world read, write,\nand execute permissions. This allowed the attributes of the child\ndirectories and their files to be modified. A local attacker could use this\nflaw to steal the JBoss ON credentials of a user running the remote client,\nor trick them into running arbitrary code. The remote client is typically\nused by privileged JBoss ON users. (CVE-2012-0032)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4858. oCERT\nacknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of\nCVE-2011-4858.\n\nWarning: Before applying the update, back up your existing JBoss ON\ninstallation (including its databases, applications, configuration files,\nthe JBoss ON server's file system directory, and so on).\n\nAll users of JBoss Operations Network 3.0.0 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Operations Network 3.0.1.\n    ",
