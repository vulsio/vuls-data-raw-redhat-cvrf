				"text": "\nRed Hat Storage is software only, scale-out storage that provides flexible\nand affordable unstructured data storage for the enterprise. GlusterFS, a\nkey building block of Red Hat Storage, is based on a stackable user-space\ndesign and can deliver exceptional performance for diverse workloads.\nGlusterFS aggregates various storage servers over network interconnects\ninto one large, parallel network file system.\n\nMultiple insecure temporary file creation flaws were found in Red Hat\nStorage. A local user on the Red Hat Storage server could use these flaws\nto cause arbitrary files to be overwritten as the root user via a symbolic\nlink attack. (CVE-2012-4417)\n\nThese issues were discovered by Kurt Seifried of Red Hat, and Jim Meyering.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* If geo-replication is started with a large number of small static files,\nE2BIG error is displayed. This is due to the way the rsync was invoked by\ngeo-replication. This issue has been fixed and geo-replication works fine\nfor large number of files. (BZ#859173)\n\n* RHS automatically modifies the smb.conf file and starts/restarts the SMB\nservice when a new volume is created, regardless of the chkconfig status of\nthe service. This results in an improper SMB configuration and errors are\nlogged. This issue has been fixed by performing a \"condrestart\" instead of\nan unconditional \"start\". (BZ#863907)\n\n* Issuing \"gluster peer probe\" command on an Fully Qualified Domain Name\n(FQDN) that contains a number as the first character in the domain name\nresulted in the command failing. This issue has been fixed by allowing\ndigits as the first character in the FQDN. (BZ#863908)\n\n* In a replicated configuration, rebooting one of the servers during active\nI/O have resulted in stale locks and caused some glusterfs commands to\nfail. This issue has been fixed by adjusting the timeout value. (BZ#866758)\n\n* In a replicated volume, when a file was in split-brain state, reads were\nstill permitted on that file from the NFS mount. This issue has been fixed\nby reporting an I/O Error. (BZ#855913)\n\n* After an upgrade, Geo-replication status is \"N/A\" if the checkpoint\nservice is not functional. This is due to the change of the location of\nunix domain sockets that are used for inter-component communication. This\nissue has been fixed by having glusterd specify the socket location to\ngsyncd. (BZ#873380)\n\n* On a replicate volume, when one of the brick is offline and from NFS\nmount when ln command is executed, the command fails. This is because\ngetattr calls lookup with a NULL parent. This issue has been fixed by\nproperly populating the parent information. (BZ#874051)\n\nIn addition, this update adds the following enhancements:\n\n* This errata includes a replication enhancement called Server-side Quorum\nenforcement, which is a means to reduce the chances of split-brains. Quorum\nenforcement is at the glusterd level and each volume can choose whether or\nnot to enforce quorum by setting the relevant volume options and the quorum\ndefault ratio is >50%. A ratio of >50% means that at any point in time,\nmore than half the number of nodes in the trusted storage pool need to be\nstarted and connected to each other. If network disconnects and outages\nhappen in such a way that a smaller portion of the storage pool is offline,\nbricks running in those nodes are taken down preventing further writes from\nhappening to the minority. For a two node cluster, quorum enforcement will\nrequire an arbitrator in the trusted storage pool which does not have\nbricks participating in that quorum enforcing volume. (BZ#840122)\n\n* sosreport is a tool which generates debugging information for the system\nit is run on. This tool has been packaged in the Red Hat Storage channel.\nThis will enable further Red Hat Storage specific tweaks and enhancements\nand improve debugability. (BZ#856673)\n\nAll users of Red Hat Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which fix these issues and add these enhancements.\n    ",
