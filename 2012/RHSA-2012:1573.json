This release is\ncurrently only available as a deployable package to run on an existing\nJBoss application server. (Users of the standalone package who require the\nCVE-2012-2379 fix immediately can obtain it from RHSA-2012:1559.) This\nrelease includes various bug fixes and enhancements which are detailed in\nthe JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.1 Release Notes. The Release Notes\nwill be available shortly from\nhttps://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nA flaw was found in the way Apache CXF verified that XML elements were\nsigned or encrypted by a particular Supporting Token. Apache CXF checked to\nensure these elements were signed or encrypted by a Supporting Token, but\nnot whether the correct token was used. A remote attacker could use this\nflaw to transmit confidential information without the appropriate security,\nand potentially circumvent access controls on web services exposed via\nApache CXF. (CVE-2012-2379)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Apache CXF project for reporting this\nissue.\n\nAll users of JBoss Enterprise BRMS Platform 5.3.0 as provided from the Red\nHat Customer Portal are advised to upgrade to JBoss Enterprise BRMS\nPlatform 5.3.1.\n    ",
