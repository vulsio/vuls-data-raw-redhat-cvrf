				"text": "\nFuse ESB Enterprise, based on Apache ServiceMix, provides an integration\nplatform.\n\nThis release of Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 serves as a replacement for Fuse\nESB Enterprise 7.0.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the\nFuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0 Release Notes for information on the most\nsignificant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly\nfrom https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/\n\nThe following security issues are also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was susceptible\nto predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\ncause the Jetty HTTP server (a component of Apache Karaf, used by Fuse ESB\nEnterprise) to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP\nrequest with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same hash\nvalue. This update introduces a limit of 1000 on the number of parameters\nprocessed per request to mitigate this issue. (CVE-2011-4461)\n\nA denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative\narrays (hashes) in JRuby. An attacker able to supply a large number of\ninputs to a JRuby application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to\na web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array\ncould trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations\ntake an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, the Murmur\nhash function has been replaced with the Perl hash function.\n(CVE-2012-5370)\n\nNote: Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.0.2 ships JRuby as part of the camel-ruby\ncomponent, which allows users to define Camel routes in Ruby. The default\nuse of JRuby in Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.0.2 does not appear to expose this\nflaw. If the version of JRuby shipped with Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.0.2 was\nused to build a custom application, then this flaw could be exposed.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4461. oCERT\nacknowledges Julian Walde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of\nCVE-2011-4461.\n\nAll users of Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse ESB Enterprise 7.1.0.\n    ",
