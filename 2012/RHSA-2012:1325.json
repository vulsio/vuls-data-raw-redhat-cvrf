				"text": "\nThe rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA flaw was found in the way QEMU handled VT100 terminal escape sequences\nwhen emulating certain character devices. A guest user with privileges to\nwrite to a character device that is emulated on the host using a virtual\nconsole back-end could use this flaw to crash the qemu-kvm process on the\nhost or, possibly, escalate their privileges on the host. (CVE-2012-3515)\n\nThis flaw did not affect the default use of Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Hypervisor: it is not possible to add a device that uses a\nvirtual console back-end via Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.\n\nTo specify a virtual console back-end for a device and therefore be\nvulnerable to this issue, the device would have to be created another way,\nfor example, by using a VDSM hook. Note that at this time hooks can only be\nused on Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts, not Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Hypervisor.\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws, leading to stack-based buffer overflows,\nwere found in glibc's functions for converting a string to a numeric\nrepresentation (strtod(), strtof(), and strtold()). If an application used\nsuch a function on attacker controlled input, it could cause the\napplication to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n(CVE-2012-3480)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the Xen project for reporting the CVE-2012-3515\nissue.\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include fixes for\nvarious security issues. These issues have no security impact on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fixes\nincluded in this update address the following CVE numbers:\n\nCVE-2012-4244 (bind issue)\n\nCVE-2012-3524 (dbus issue)\n\nCVE-2012-2313, CVE-2012-2384, CVE-2012-2390, CVE-2012-3430, and\nCVE-2012-3552 (kernel issues)\n\nCVE-2012-3445 (libvirt issue)\n\nCVE-2011-3102 and CVE-2012-2807 (libxml2 issues)\n\nCVE-2011-1202, CVE-2011-3970, CVE-2012-2825, CVE-2012-2870, CVE-2012-2871,\nand CVE-2012-2893 (libxslt issues)\n\nThis updated Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor package also\nfixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, the Manager listed all installed Hypervisor ISO images as\navailable even when they did not support the VDSM compatibility version\nrequired by the selected host. The rhev-hypervisor6 package now maintains a\ntext file for each installed ISO image. The file lists the VDSM\ncompatibility versions supported by the relevant ISO image. The Manager\nuses this information to ensure that only those Hypervisor ISO images that\nare relevant to the selected host are listed. (BZ#856827)\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.\n    ",
