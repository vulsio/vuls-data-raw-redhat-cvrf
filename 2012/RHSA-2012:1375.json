				"text": "\nThe rhev-hypervisor6 package provides a Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor ISO disk image. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor\nis a dedicated Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. It includes\neverything necessary to run and manage virtual machines: A subset of the\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux operating environment and the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Agent.\n\nNote: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor is only available for\nthe Intel 64 and AMD64 architectures with virtualization extensions.\n\nA flaw was found in the way socket buffers (skb) requiring TSO (TCP segment\noffloading) were handled by the sfc driver. If the skb did not fit within\nthe minimum-size of the transmission queue, the network card could\nrepeatedly reset itself. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2012-3412)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ben Hutchings of Solarflare (tm) for reporting\nthis issue.\n\nThis updated package provides updated components that include a fix for\none security issue. This issue had no security impact on Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Hypervisor itself, however. The security fix included in\nthis update addresses the following CVE number:\n\nCVE-2012-4423 (libvirt issue)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bug:\n\n* A dependency issue was found between the rhev-hypervisor-tools and\nrhev-hypervisor6-tools packages. Every time a user with one of the -tools\npackages installed ran \"yum update\", the -tools package they had installed\nwas removed and the other one installed. Even though rhev-hypervisor-tools\nobsoleted rhev-hypervisor6-tools, this update includes an updated\nrhev-hypervisor6-tools package that corrects this issue. Note that the\npackage does not have meaningful content, is only here to fix the\ndependency issue, and may be removed by a future update. (BZ#855391)\n\nThis update includes the ovirt-node build from RHBA-2012:1374:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-1374.html\n\nUsers of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor are advised to\nupgrade to this updated package, which fixes these issues.\n    ",
