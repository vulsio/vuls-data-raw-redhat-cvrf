				"text": "\nThe openstack-keystone packages provide Keystone, a Python implementation\nof the OpenStack identity service API, which provides Identity, Token,\nCatalog, and Policy services.\n\nThe openstack-keystone packages have been upgraded to upstream version\n2012.1.3, which provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the\nprevious version. (BZ#867029)\n\nThis update also fixes the following security issues:\n\nIt was found that Keystone did not correctly handle users being removed\nfrom tenants when Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) style\ncredentials (credentials that are issued in the same format as standard\nAmazon EC2 credentials) were in use. When a user was removed from a tenant,\nthey retained the privileges provided by that tenant, allowing them to\naccess resources they should no longer have access to. (CVE-2012-5571)\n\nWhen access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) was configured,\na file permissions flaw in Keystone allowed a local attacker to view the\nadministrative access and secret values used for authenticating requests to\nAmazon EC2 services. An attacker could use this flaw to access Amazon EC2\nand enable, disable, and modify services and settings. (CVE-2012-5483)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank the OpenStack project for reporting\nCVE-2012-5571. Upstream acknowledges Vijaya Erukala as the original\nreporter of CVE-2012-5571. The CVE-2012-5483 issue was discovered by Kurt\nSeifried of the Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nAll users of openstack-keystone are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct these issues and add these enhancements. After\ninstalling the updated packages, the Keystone service (openstack-keystone)\nwill be restarted automatically.\n    ",
