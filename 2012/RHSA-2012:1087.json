				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n\n* It was found that the data_len parameter of the sock_alloc_send_pskb()\nfunction in the Linux kernel's networking implementation was not validated\nbefore use. A local user with access to a TUN/TAP virtual interface could\nuse this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their\nprivileges. Note that unprivileged users cannot access TUN/TAP devices\nuntil the root user grants them access. (CVE-2012-2136, Important)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* An insufficiently designed calculation in the CPU accelerator in the\nprevious kernel caused an arithmetic overflow in the sched_clock() function\nwhen system uptime exceeded 208.5 days. This overflow led to a kernel panic\non the systems using the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) or Virtual Machine\nInterface (VMI) clock source. This update corrects the described\ncalculation so that this arithmetic overflow and kernel panic can no longer\noccur under these circumstances. (BZ#825981, BZ#835449)\n\n* Previously, a race condition between the journal_write_metadata_buffer()\nand jbd_unlock_bh_state() functions could occur. Consequently, another\nthread could call the get_write_access() function on the buffer head and\ncause the wrong data to be written into the journal. If the system\nterminated unexpectedly or was shut down incorrectly, subsequent file\nsystem journal replay could result in file system corruption. This update\nfixes the race condition and the file system corruption no longer occurs in\nthe described scenario. (BZ#833764)\n\n* When the kvmclock initialization was used in a guest, it could write to\nthe Time Stamp Counter (TSC) and, under certain circumstances, could cause\nthe kernel to become unresponsive on boot. With this update, TSC\nsynchronization, which is unnecessary due to kvmclock, has been disabled,\nthus fixing this bug. (BZ#834557)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
