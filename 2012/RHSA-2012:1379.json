				"text": "\nOpenStack Swift (http://swift.openstack.org) is a highly available,\ndistributed, eventually consistent object/blob store.\n\nIt was found that OpenStack Swift used the Python pickle module in an\ninsecure way to serialize and deserialize data from memcached. As\nmemcached does not have authentication, an attacker on the local network,\nor possibly an unprivileged user in a virtual machine hosted on OpenStack,\ncould use this flaw to inject specially-crafted data that would lead to\narbitrary code execution. (CVE-2012-4406)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE Security Team for\nreporting this issue.\n\nNote: The fix for CVE-2012-4406 is not enabled by default, and requires\nmanual action on the affected Proxy nodes. This update adds a\n\"memcache_serialization_support\" option. It is configured in\n\"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf\" and is set to \"0\" by default. This default\nsetting is vulnerable to CVE-2012-4406.\n\nTo enable the fix, this option must be changed; however, the required\nchanges can have a temporary, large performance impact. The following\ninstructions aim to minimize performance issues:\n\n1) Install the updated openstack-swift packages.\n\n2) In \"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf\", set the\n\"memcache_serialization_support\" option in the memcache/[filter:cache]\nsection to \"1\". (The default value, \"0\", leaves you vulnerable to\nCVE-2012-4406.) When set to \"1\", the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\nformat is used but pickle is still supported. This configuration is still\nvulnerable, but new data will be stored in JSON format.\n\n3) After setting the option to \"1\", run \"service openstack-swift-proxy\nrestart\".\n\n4) After 24 hours, set the \"memcache_serialization_support\" option in\n\"/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf\" to \"2\". \"2\" is the secure option: only JSON\nis used.\n\n5) After setting the option to \"2\", run \"service openstack-swift-proxy\nrestart\".\n\nIf \"memcache_serialization_support\" is set directly from \"0\" to \"2\", all\ndata in memcached will be flushed and re-created. This can lead to a\ntemporary, large performance impact.\n\nAll users of openstack-swift are advised to upgrade to these updated\npackages, which correct this issue.\n    ",
