				"text": "\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is a visual tool for centrally\nmanaging collections of virtual servers running Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nand Microsoft Windows. This package also includes the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Manager API, a set of scriptable commands that give\nadministrators the ability to perform queries and operations on Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Manager.\n\nA flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts were added to\nthe Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. The Python scripts\nneeded to configure the host for Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were\nstored in the \"/tmp/\" directory and could be pre-created by an attacker. A\nlocal, unprivileged user on the host to be added to the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization environment could use this flaw to escalate their\nprivileges. This update provides the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nManager part of the fix. The RHSA-2012:1508 VDSM update (Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux hosts) must also be installed to completely fix this issue.\n(CVE-2012-0860)\n\nA flaw was found in the way Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Hypervisor hosts were added to the Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization environment. The Python scripts needed to configure the host\nfor Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization were downloaded in an insecure way,\nthat is, without properly validating SSL certificates during HTTPS\nconnections. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to\nconduct a man-in-the-middle attack, potentially gaining root access to the\nhost being added to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization environment. This\nupdate provides the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager part of the\nfix. The RHSA-2012:1508 VDSM update (Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts) or\nRHSA-2012:1505 rhev-hypervisor6 update (Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization\nHypervisor hosts) must also be installed to completely fix this issue.\n(CVE-2012-0861)\n\nIt was found that under certain conditions, Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Manager would fail to lock the screen on a virtual machine\nbetween SPICE (Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments)\nsessions. A user with access to a virtual machine in Red Hat Enterprise\nVirtualization Manager could potentially exploit this flaw to gain access\nto another user's unlocked desktop session. (CVE-2011-4316)\n\nIt was found that Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager did not\ncorrectly pass wipe-after-delete when moving disks between storage domains.\nThis resulted in such disks not being securely deleted as expected,\npotentially leading to information disclosure. (CVE-2012-5516)\n\nA flaw was found in the way the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager\nback end checked the privileges of users making requests via the SOAP and\nGWT APIs. An authenticated attacker able to issue queries against Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Manager could use this flaw to query data that\nthey should not have access to. (CVE-2012-2696)\n\nThese issues were discovered by Red Hat.\n\nIn addition to resolving the above security issues these updated Red Hat\nEnterprise Virtualization Manager packages fix various bugs, and add\nvarious enhancements.\n\nDocumentation for these bug fixes and enhancements is available in the\nTechnical Notes:\n\nhttps://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Virtualization/3.1/html/Technical_Notes/index.html\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager users are advised to upgrade\nto these updated packages which resolve these security issues, fix these\nbugs, and add these enhancements.\n    ",
