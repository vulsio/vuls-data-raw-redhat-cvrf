A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to\ncause a denial of service. (CVE-2012-2390, Moderate)\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Event Poll (epoll)\nsubsystem handled resource clean up when an ELOOP error code was returned.\nA local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of\nservice. (CVE-2012-3375, Moderate)\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The MRG 2.1 realtime kernel lacked support for automatic memory\nreservation for the kdump kernel, as present in Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nkernels. Using the parameter crashkernel=auto on the kernel boot command\nline led to kdump being disabled because no memory was correctly reserved.\nSupport for crashkernel=auto has been implemented in the 3.0 realtime\nkernel and now when the crashkernel=auto parameter is specified, machines\nwith more than 4GB of RAM have the amount of memory required by the kdump\nkernel calculated and reserved. (BZ#820427)\n\n* The current bnx2x driver in the MRG 2.1 realtime kernel had faulty\nsupport for the network adapter PCI ID 14e4:168e and did not work\ncorrectly. The bnx2x driver was updated to include support for this network\nadapter. (BZ#839037)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which upgrade the kernel-rt\nkernel to version kernel-rt-3.0.36-rt57, and correct these issues. The\nsystem must be rebooted for this update to take effect.\n    ",
