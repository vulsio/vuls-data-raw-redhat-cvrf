				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n\n* A flaw was found in the way socket buffers (skb) requiring TSO (TCP\nsegment offloading) were handled by the sfc driver. If the skb did not fit\nwithin the minimum-size of the transmission queue, the network card could\nrepeatedly reset itself. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2012-3412, Important)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Ben Hutchings of Solarflare (tm) for reporting\nthis issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* In the hpet_next_event() function, an interrupt could have occurred\nbetween the read and write of the HPET (High Precision Event Timer) and the\nvalue of HPET_COUNTER was then beyond that being written to the comparator\n(HPET_Tn_CMP). Consequently, the timers were overdue for up to several\nminutes. Now, a comparison is performed between the value of the counter\nand the comparator in the HPET code. If the counter is beyond the\ncomparator, the \"-ETIME\" error code is returned, which fixes this bug.\n(BZ#855280)\n\n* Traffic to the NFS server could trigger a kernel oops in the\nsvc_tcp_clear_pages() function. The source code has been modified, and the\nkernel oops no longer occurs in this scenario. (BZ#856104)\n\n* A kernel oops occurred in the nf_nat code when a bogus pointer was\ndereferenced in the nf_conn_nat structure. Consequently, if Source Network\nAddress Translation (SNAT) was performed, incorrect information could be\nreceived by other CTS (Clear to Send) signals. A conntrack entry is now\nplaced in the source hash after SNAT has been completed, which prevents the\ndescribed problems. (BZ#865714)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to resolve these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
