The Release Notes will be available\nshortly from https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was susceptible\nto predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\ncause the Jetty HTTP server (a component of Apache Karaf, used by Fuse\nManagement Console) to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an\nHTTP request with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same\nhash value. This update introduces a limit of 1000 on the number of\nparameters processed per request to mitigate this issue. (CVE-2011-4461)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting this issue. oCERT\nacknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters.\n\nAll users of Fuse Management Console 1.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat\nCustomer Portal are advised to upgrade to Fuse Management Console 7.1.0.\n    ",
