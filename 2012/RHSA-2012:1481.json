				"text": "\nThe kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux\noperating system.\n\nThis update fixes the following security issue:\n\n* A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's dl2k driver, used by\ncertain D-Link Gigabit Ethernet adapters, restricted IOCTLs. A local,\nunprivileged user could use this flaw to issue potentially harmful IOCTLs,\nwhich could cause Ethernet adapters using the dl2k driver to malfunction\n(for example, losing network connectivity). (CVE-2012-2313, Low)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Stephan Mueller for reporting this issue.\n\nThis update also fixes the following bugs:\n\n* The QLogic netxen_nic driver has been upgraded to version 4.0.75, which\nprovides several bug fixes. This update also allows users to set speed and\nautomatic negotiation parameters for Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) ports. Note\nthat QLogic devices do not support half-duplex data transmission at the\nmoment. (BZ#865304)\n\n* When the ext3_dx_add_entry() function had to split a directory index\nnode, it had to ensure that the name_len variable of the new dx_node's\nfake_dirent structure was set to zero. Otherwise, the e2fsck tool did not\nrecognize it as an intermediate htree node and considered the htree node to\nbe corrupted. The dx_node's fake_dirent structure is now always explicitly\nset to zero, which prevents the corruption in this scenario. (BZ#866548)\n\n* Previously, the error cleanup logic was incorrect: once an error was\ndetected, the same error was reported on every polling cycle (the default\nbehavior is to poll every second). This caused an excessive amount of Error\nDetection And Correction (EDAC) messages to be logged in the\n/var/log/messages file. This update fixes the error cleanup logic, which\nprevents the unnecessary messages from being logged. (BZ#866796)\n\nUsers should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported\npatches to correct these issues. The system must be rebooted for this\nupdate to take effect.\n    ",
