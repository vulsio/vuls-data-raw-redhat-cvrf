				"text": "\nFuse MQ Enterprise, based on Apache ActiveMQ, is a standards compliant\nmessaging system that is tailored for use in mission critical applications.\n\nThis release of Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 serves as a replacement for Fuse\nMQ Enterprise 7.0.2, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Refer to the\nFuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0 Release Notes for information on the most\nsignificant of these changes. The Release Notes will be available shortly\nfrom https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/\n\nThe following security issue is also fixed with this release:\n\nIt was found that the Java hashCode() method implementation was susceptible\nto predictable hash collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to\ncause the Jetty HTTP server (a component of Apache Karaf, used by Fuse MQ\nEnterprise) to use an excessive amount of CPU time by sending an HTTP\nrequest with a large number of parameters whose names map to the same hash\nvalue. This update introduces a limit of 1000 on the number of parameters\nprocessed per request to mitigate this issue. (CVE-2011-4461)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting this issue. oCERT\nacknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters.\n\nAll users of Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat Customer\nPortal are advised to upgrade to Fuse MQ Enterprise 7.1.0.\n    ",
