FTP is a method of transferring files between\nmachines.\n\nGlenn Stewart discovered a flaw in wu-ftpd.  When configured with\n\"restricted-gid home\",  an authorized user could use this flaw to\ncircumvent the configured home directory restriction by using chmod.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0148 to this issue.\n\nMichael Hendrickx found a flaw in the S/Key login handling.  On servers\nusing S/Key authentication, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and\npotentially execute arbitrary code. \n\nUsers of wu-ftpd are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which\ncontains backported security patches and is not vulnerable to these issues.\n    ",
