The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0109 to this issue.\n\nSolar Designer from OpenWall discovered a minor information leak in the\next3 filesystem code due to the lack of initialization of journal\ndescriptor blocks.  This flaw has only minor security implications and\nexploitation requires privileged access to the raw device.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0177 to this issue.\n\nThese packages also contain an updated fix with additional checks for\nissues in the R128 Direct Render Infrastructure.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0003 to this issue.\n\nAdditionally, hardening of the mremap function was applied to\nprevent a potential local denial of service attack.\n\nAll users are advised to upgrade to these errata packages, which contain\nbackported security patches that correct these issues.\n    ",
