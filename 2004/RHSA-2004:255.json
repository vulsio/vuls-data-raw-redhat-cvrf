The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0554 to this issue.\n\nAnother flaw was discovered in an error path supporting the clone()\nsystem call that allowed local users to cause a denial of service\n(memory leak) by passing invalid arguments to clone() running in an\ninfinite loop of a user's program.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0427\nto this issue.\n\nEnhancements were committed to the 2.6 kernel by Al Viro which enabled the\nSparse source code checking tool to check for a certain class of kernel\nbugs. A subset of these fixes also applies to various drivers in the 2.4\nkernel.  Although the majority of these resides in drivers unsupported in\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 3, the flaws could lead to privilege escalation or\naccess to kernel memory.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0495 to these issues.\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.  These packages contain\nbackported patches to correct these issues.\n    ",
