				"text": "\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the\noperating system.\n\nThis is the second regular kernel update to Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux version 3.  It contains several minor\nsecurity fixes, many bug fixes, device driver updates,\nnew hardware support, and the introduction of Linux\nSyscall Auditing support.\n\nThere were bug fixes in many different parts of the kernel,\nthe bulk of which addressed unusual situations such as error\nhandling, race conditions, and resource starvation.  The\ncombined effect of the approximately 140 fixes is a strong\nimprovement in the reliability and durability of Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux.  Some of the key areas affected are disk\ndrivers, network drivers, USB support, x86_64 and ppc64\nplatform support, ia64 32-bit emulation layer enablers,\nand the VM, NFS, IPv6, and SCSI subsystems.\n\nA significant change in the SCSI subsystem (the disabling\nof the scsi-affine-queue patch) should significantly improve\nSCSI disk driver performance in many scenarios.  There were\n10 Bugzillas against SCSI performance problems addressed\nby this change.\n\nThe following drivers have been upgraded to new versions:\n\n  bonding ---- 2.4.1\n  cciss ------ 2.4.50.RH1\n  e1000 ------ 5.2.30.1-k1\n  fusion ----- 2.05.11.03\n  ipr -------- 1.0.3\n  ips -------- 6.11.07\n  megaraid2 -- 2.10.1.1\n  qla2x00 ---- 6.07.02-RH1\n  tg3 -------- 3.1\n  z90crypt --- 1.1.4\n\nThis update introduces support for the new Intel EM64T\nprocessor.  A new \"ia32e\" architecture has been created to\nsupport booting on platforms based on either the original\nAMD Opteron CPU or the new Intel EM64T CPU.  The existing\n\"x86_64\" architecture has remained optimized for Opteron\nsystems.  Kernels for both types of systems are built from\nthe same x86_64-architecture sources and share a common\nkernel source RPM (kernel-source-2.4.21-15.EL.x86_64.rpm).\n\nOther highlights in this update include a major upgrade to\nthe SATA infrastructure, addition of IBM JS20 Power Blade\nsupport, and creation of an optional IBM eServer zSeries\nOn-Demand Timer facility for reducing idle CPU overhead.\n\nThe following security issues were addressed in this update:\n\nA minor flaw was found where /proc/tty/driver/serial reveals\nthe exact character counts for serial links.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the name CAN-2003-0461 to this issue.\n\nThe kernel strncpy() function in Linux 2.4 and 2.5 does not\npad the target buffer with null bytes on architectures other\nthan x86, as opposed to the expected libc behavior, which\ncould lead to information leaks.  The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0465 to this issue.\n\nA minor data leak was found in two real time clock drivers\n(for /dev/rtc).  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2003-0984 to this issue.\n\nA flaw in the R128 Direct Render Infrastructure (dri) driver\ncould allow local privilege escalation.  This driver is part\nof the kernel-unsupported package.  The Common Vulnera-\nbilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0003 to this issue.\n\nA flaw in ncp_lookup() in ncpfs could allow local privilege\nescalation.  The ncpfs module allows a system to mount\nvolumes of NetWare servers or print to NetWare printers and\nis in the kernel-unsupported package.  The Common Vulnera-\nbilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2004-0010 to this issue.\n\n(Note that the kernel-unsupported package contains drivers\nand other modules that are unsupported and therefore might\ncontain security problems that have not been addressed.)\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 users are advised to upgrade\ntheir kernels to the packages associated with their machine\narchitectures and configurations as listed in this erratum.\n    ",
