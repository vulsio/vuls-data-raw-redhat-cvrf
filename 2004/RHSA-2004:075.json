				"text": "\nKonqueror is a file manager and Web browser for the K Desktop Environment\n(KDE).\n\nFlaws have been found in the cookie path handling between a number of Web\nbrowsers and servers.  The HTTP cookie standard allows a Web server\nsupplying a cookie to a client to specify a subset of URLs on the origin\nserver to which the cookie applies.  Web servers such as Apache do not\nfilter returned cookies and assume that the client will only send back\ncookies for requests that fall within the server-supplied subset of URLs.\nHowever, by supplying URLs that use path traversal (/../) and character\nencoding, it is possible to fool many browsers into sending a cookie to a\npath outside of the originally-specified subset.\n\nKDE version 3.1.3 and later include a patch to Konquerer that disables the\nsending of cookies to the server if the URL contains such encoded\ntraversals.  Red Hat Linux 9 shipped with KDE 3.1 and is therefore\nvulnerable to this issue.\n\nUsers of Konquerer are advised to upgrade to these erratum packages, which\ncontain a backported patch for this issue.\n    ",

						"text": "\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt\n    ",
