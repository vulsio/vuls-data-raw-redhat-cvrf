A local user could exploit this vulnerability to gain\n\"slocate\" group privileges and then read the entire slocate database.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2003-0848 to this issue.\n\nUsers of Slocate should upgrade to these erratum packages, which contain a\npatch from Kevin Lindsay that causes slocate to drop privileges before\nreading a user-supplied database.\n    ",

						"text": "\nBefore applying this update, make sure all previously released errata\nrelevant to your system have been applied.\n\nTo update all RPMs for your particular architecture, run:\n\nrpm -Fvh [filenames]\n\nwhere [filenames] is a list of the RPMs you wish to upgrade.  Only those\nRPMs which are currently installed will be updated.  Those RPMs which are\nnot installed but included in the list will not be updated.  Note that you\ncan also use wildcards (*.rpm) if your current directory *only* contains the\ndesired RPMs.\n\nPlease note that this update is also available via Red Hat Network.  Many\npeople find this an easier way to apply updates.  To use Red Hat Network,\nlaunch the Red Hat Update Agent with the following command:\n\nup2date\n\nThis will start an interactive process that will result in the appropriate\nRPMs being upgraded on your system.\n\nIf up2date fails to connect to Red Hat Network due to SSL Certificate \nErrors, you need to install a version of the up2date client with an updated \ncertificate.  The latest version of up2date is available from the Red Hat \nFTP site and may also be downloaded directly from the RHN website:\n\nhttps://rhn.redhat.com/help/latest-up2date.pxt\n    ",
