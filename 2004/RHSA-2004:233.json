The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0414 to this issue.\n\nStefan Esser and Sebastian Krahmer conducted an audit of CVS and fixed a\nnumber of issues that may have had security consequences.\n\nAmong the issues deemed likely to be exploitable were: \n\n-- a double-free relating to the error_prog_name string (CAN-2004-0416)\n-- an argument integer overflow (CAN-2004-0417)\n-- out-of-bounds writes in serv_notify (CAN-2004-0418).\n\nAn attacker who has access to a CVS server may be able to execute arbitrary\ncode under the UID on which the CVS server is executing. \n\nUsers of CVS are advised to upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nbackported patches correcting these issues.\n\nRed Hat would like to thank Stefan Esser, Sebastian Krahmer, and Derek\nPrice for auditing, disclosing, and providing patches for these issues.\n    ",
