The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CAN-2004-0155 to this issue.\n\nWhen ipsec-tools receives an ISAKMP header, it will attempt to allocate\nsufficient memory for the entire ISAKMP message according to the header's\nlength field. If an attacker crafts an ISAKMP header with a extremely large\nvalue in the length field, racoon may exceed operating system resource\nlimits and be terminated, resulting in a denial of service.  The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name\nCAN-2004-0403 to this issue.\n\nUser of IPSEC should upgrade to this updated package, which contains\nipsec-tools version 0.25 along with a security patch for CAN-2004-0403\nwhich resolves all these issues.\n    ",
