This flaw also applied to glibc\nversions before 2.3.2.  An attacker who is able to send DNS responses\n(perhaps by creating a malicious DNS server) could remotely exploit this\nvulnerability to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.  The\nCommon Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned\nthe name CAN-2002-0029 to this issue.\n\nThese updated packages also fix a dlclose function bug on certain shared\nlibraries, which caused program crashes.\n\nAll users of glibc should upgrade to these updated packages, which\nresolve these issues.\n    ",
