				"text": "\nThe Linux kernel handles the basic functions of the operating\nsystem.\n\nThis is the sixth regular kernel update to Red Hat Enterprise Linux version\n2.1. It updates a number of device drivers, and adds much improved SATA\nsupport.\n\nThis update includes fixes for several security issues:\n\nPaul Starzetz of iSEC discovered various flaws in the ELF binary\nloader affecting kernels prior to 2.4.28. A local user could use these\nflaws to gain read access to executable-only binaries or possibly gain\nprivileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\n(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names CAN-2004-1070, CAN-2004-1071,\nCAN-2004-1072, and CAN-2004-1073 to these issues.\n\nA missing serialization flaw in unix_dgram_recvmsg was discovered that\naffects kernels prior to 2.4.28. A local user could potentially make\nuse of a race condition in order to gain privileges. (CAN-2004-1068)\n\nStefan Esser discovered various flaws including buffer overflows in\nthe smbfs driver affecting kernels before 2.4.28. A local user may be\nable to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly gain privileges.\nIn order to exploit these flaws the user would need to have control of\na connected smb server. (CAN-2004-0883, CAN-2004-0949)\n\nConectiva discovered flaws in certain USB drivers affecting kernels\nbefore 2.4.27 which used the copy_to_user function on uninitialized\nstructures. These flaws could allow local users to read small\namounts of kernel memory. (CAN-2004-0685)\n\nThe ext3 code in kernels before 2.4.26 did not properly initialize journal\ndescriptor blocks. A privileged local user could read portions of kernel\nmemory. (CAN-2004-0177)\n\nThe following drivers have also been updated:\n\n* tg3 v3.10\n* e1000 v5.3.19-k2\n* e100 v3.0.27-k2\n* megaraid \n* megaraid2 v2.10.8.2\n\nAll Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 users are advised to upgrade their kernels\nto the packages associated with their machine architectures and\nconfigurations as listed in this erratum.\n    ",
