				"text": "\nKerberos is a networked authentication system that uses a trusted third\nparty (a KDC) to authenticate clients and servers to each other.\n\nSeveral double-free bugs were found in the Kerberos 5 KDC and libraries.  A\nremote attacker could potentially exploit these flaws to execuate arbitrary\ncode.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has\nassigned the names CAN-2004-0642 and CAN-2004-0643 to these issues.\n\nA double-free bug was also found in the krb524 server (CAN-2004-0772),\nhowever this issue does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Kerberos\npackages.\n\nAn infinite loop bug was found in the Kerberos 5 ASN.1 decoder library.  A\nremote attacker may be able to trigger this flaw and cause a denial of\nservice. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)\nhas assigned the name CAN-2004-0644 to this issue.\n\nWhen attempting to contact a KDC, the Kerberos libraries will iterate\nthrough the list of configured servers, attempting to contact each in turn.\nIf one of the servers becomes unresponsive, the client will time out and\ncontact the next configured server.  When the library attempts to contact\nthe next KDC, the entire process is repeated.  For applications which must\ncontact a KDC several times, the accumulated time spent waiting can become\nsignificant.\n\nThis update modifies the libraries, notes which server for a given realm\nlast responded to a request, and attempts to contact that server first\nbefore contacting any of the other configured servers.\n\nAll users of krb5 should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain\nbackported security patches to resolve these issues.\n    ",
